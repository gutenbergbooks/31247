<p><span class="smcap">The</span> intelligent reader, on opening a new
book, asks why it was written,&mdash;what excuse
has it for existence. In this particular case
the author has more reasons than it is worth
while to repeat. If there is any one thing that
is attracting the general attention of the
American people, it is the art of music. It is a
good sign. It shows we are getting beyond the
mere tree-felling and prairie-clearing stages of
our existence, and coming to something better.
This true &#8220;Tale of a Violin&#8221; has to do with
music. It is the story of a real musical life;
not wholly American, and therefore instructive.
It has much, also, to do with our people and
country and our own times, and is therefore
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iv" id="Page_iv">[iv]</a></span>interesting and home-like. It has to do with
methods of teaching music in foreign countries;
and for the student this artist-life is full of
valuable suggestions. All of this can be properly
said, because it is the artist-life of a
person now living among us. These are the
excuses for its existence.</p>

<p>The facts and incidents were supplied by
Madam Camilla Urso herself at such stray
moments of leisure as could be found during a
busy concert season at Boston, in the months
of January and February, 1874; and the work
was done at such spare moments as the writer
could find in the midst of journalistic cares.
Such events as could be noted in one evening
having been written out, they were read aloud
before Madam Urso and others, and when
brought up to the exact truth in every detail,
and fully approved by such persons as were
entitled to an opinion, were given to the
printer.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v" id="Page_v">[v]</a></span>So the book came to be. If it leads one
reader to see the value of a life devoted to
art,&mdash;if it helps one lonely student struggling
for a musical education, by the splendid example
of a life of toil and poverty crowned by
a great reward,&mdash;the work will not be wholly
vain, nor will it want excuse for being.</p>

<p>The author would express his thanks for the
kind assistance of the Urso family of New
York, and Mr. John S. Dwight and others,
of Boston.</p>

<p>About thirty miles from the sea, on the River Loire,
in France, stands the quaint, sleepy old town of Nantes.
The Erdre and the Sevre, two smaller streams unite
with the Loire just here and the town is spread out in
an irregular fashion over the islands, the little capes
between the rivers, and the hills that stand round
about. The old part of the town is on the hill-side
and occupies the two islands called Freydean and
Gloriette, the more modern city has spread over the
surrounding country among the groves of chestnut, and
the vineyards that fill every available spot where the
grapes can get a good look at the sun all through the
long sunny days.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>The river runs swift and bright through the town
and flashes under the handsome bridges with their long
rows of stone arches. In the river are boats, ships, and
steamers, for the good people there spend much of
their time in commerce and in catching and curing the
silver-white pilchards that swim in such great schools
in the neighboring sea.</p>

<p>The broad quays that skirt the river are planted
with trees, making a most delightful walk, and near
the eastern end of the town one of the quays ends at
what remains of an old chateau or palace. The
houses are mostly of stone, with slated roofs. There
are some fine stores in the Place Royal that are quite
as grand as those in Paris. There are also some old,
old churches black with age, dim and vast inside, with
statuary on the outer walls, and splendid gothic
towers that seem to blossom all over with stone flowers
as they climb so far up into the sky above the quaint
old town.</p>

<p>Round about the town are gardens and summer
houses, pleasant walks and drives, vineyards, groves
and all the things that go to make a charming rural
scene.</p>

<p>In the Place Graslin is a fine theatre and a handsome
Town Hall. Of these buildings more presently
when we come to see what happened within them.</p>

<p>In this old French town in June 1846 there lived a
very little girl just four years old. Her home was on
the first floor of a small house on a narrow street not
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>far from the Place de la Monnaie, an open square that
led into one of the principal streets known as the Rue
Voltaire. The house was built in the usual French
fashion with a large arch-way under the house that led
into a court-yard in the centre. The front door opened
into the shady arch-way, and the window balconies
were filled with flowering plants in pots.</p>

<p>Her name was Camilla. Her father Monsieur Salvatore
Urso played the flute in the orchestra at the
theatre, or opera house, and on Sundays played the organ
at the Church of the Holy Cross that stood facing
a little square not far from the river.</p>

<p>Her mother Madame Emelie Urso was a young and
very handsome woman, and a fine singer. She also
helped her husband in his music lessons. She was
born in Lisbon in Portugal, but as she had come
to France when quite young, she had forgotten her
mother tongue and now spoke French and Italian.
This last may have been owing to the fact that her
husband was from Palermo, Sicily. With Camilla&#8217;s
parents lived her mother&#8217;s sister, Caroline, whom we
shall know as aunt Caroline. This made the Urso
household.</p>

<p>Both of Camilla&#8217;s parents were young and she was
their oldest child and only daughter. There was at
this time a baby brother and later there were three
more brothers. The first four years of the little one&#8217;s
life were passed in an uneventful manner, very much
in the fashion of other children everywhere. When
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>she was four years old she began to go to the theatre
with her father. Every night she put her small hand
in his and trotted off to the Place Graslin to sit with
him in the orchestra among the violins and close beside
her father&#8217;s flute. He was a noted player in those days
and the little one shared his seat, with the music book
spread before her, and the stage in full view.</p>

<p>It was quite a fine theatre and many notable things
took place there. Operas, both new and old, were
given, and often between the acts, a piano was brought
out and such famous players as traveled in that part of
France appeared and showed what they could do.
Celebrated violinists and great singers also appeared
at times. So it happened that the little Camilla almost
lived in the midst of an orchestra and before she was
five years old had heard many of the best players and
singers of the times.</p>

<p>The orchestra became almost a second home to her.
The lights, the crowds of people, the music were every
day matters and she grew up to be quite indifferent to
the public character of such a life. Most children
would have soon learned to go to sleep in the midst of
it all. Camilla never thought of such a thing. While
the music went on she was content. If she could only
nestle down in a corner where she could hear those violins
and her father&#8217;s flute she was perfectly happy in a
demure and sober fashion that was infinitely amusing in
such a very small girl.</p>

<p>On Sundays and on f&ecirc;te days when the church was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>open she went with her father to the church of the
Holy Cross.</p>

<p>The church was an old one and to reach the organ
loft high up over the great portal they had to climb a
steep and winding stair in the great tower. The stairs
were worn deep with footsteps so that it was hard
climbing for the little one. Still, she always went with
her father and mother. Did he not play the tall organ
with its great white pipes, and did her mother not
sing? She had a good seat where she could look up
at the black arches springing so high overhead, or
down on the people who seemed so small in the church
far below.</p>

<p>When there was no theatre or church she played
about her mother&#8217;s room or under the trees in the public
gardens, very much in the fashion of other French
girls.</p>

<p>Playing in an orchestra is not the road to wealth.
The pay was very small, and even with the organ salary
and the music lessons things did not prosper very
happily and the little Camilla had to content herself
with such juvenile joys as could be procured without
very much money. This, happily, did not make much
difference. There was enough to eat and pretty good
things to wear and no end of music. This last seemed
to quite satisfy her. The orchestra, the organ and the
choir afforded her perpetual amusement, and her life
was as happy as that of the most favored child in the
town.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>When not listening to music she was very active and
merry and displayed an abundant fund of good health
and spirits. She early learned to talk and walk and
was considered an unusually bright and precocious girl.
Her earliest months gave a hint of her love for music.
If fretful or peevish with weariness or ill-health she
could soon be pacified by a gentle song from her father
as he carried her about in his arms.</p>

<p>The first intimation of a desire to make music herself
came when she was three years old. Hearing a hand-organ
play in the street while the family were at dinner
she softly left the table and went into the next
room. Presently the tune on the hand-organ was repeated
on the piano in the parlor. Her father opened
the door quickly only to find the child trying to hide, as
if she had done something wrong.</p>

<p>Before she could talk she could hum over or sing a
number of songs, and at four years of age could repeat
in a thin piping voice many of the songs and airs sung
by her mother and always insisting that the accompaniment
should be played while she sang.</p>

<p>She did not go to school. Hardly any children in
the town had any such advantage. There were a few
small primary schools and that was about all the
chance that was open to the young people of Nantes
for an education.</p>

<p>So far in Camilla&#8217;s life it did not make any particular
difference. Things were going on quite to her satisfaction
and she was perfectly happy even if she could
not read or write.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>Thus in a quiet way with much music the months
had slipped away till she was five years old. Then
suddenly came the awakening of a new life. Something
happened that cast the rosy glow of coming day
over the twilight of her life. The morning star that
shone out clear and bright before her young eyes took
the shape of a violin solo in a mass called St. Cecilia.
She was in the church when its promise-speaking light
flashed upon her. There was an orchestra, and a full
chorus, with the organ. The little Camilla now almost
six years old sat in the old organ loft and heard it all.
She listened and dreamed and wondered and wished
and wished she could only do something like that solo
for the first violin. An ordinary piece of music, indifferently
played, but somehow it enchained her whole
attention. It threw wide open the pearly gates of a
new and fairer life.</p>

<p>Many a time she had heard famous players at the
theatre. They had never interested her as did this
one. He was not a very fine player. His music was
not particularly wonderful, but there was something
about it that pleased her greatly. She had been
already excited by the music. The majestic and noble
character of the mass, the chorus sounding so loud
and grand through the church, the orchestra, her father&#8217;s
organ with its great thunder tones rolling under
it all, had sent the blood tingling through her veins.
The great company kneeling on the floor so far below.
The lights and flowers on the altar. The blue clouds
of incense rising softly on the air and the dusky bars of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>colored light slanting across the springing arches. The
scene, the music, everything affected her. Then that
song on the violin. It was beautiful&mdash;and&mdash;if she
could. No&mdash;she never, never could&mdash;and it was all a
dream. She was even reluctant to leave for home after
the service was over and wanted to linger in the
vast, dim church and dream it all over again.</p>

<p>If she only could play like that&mdash;if she could have
a real violin, all her own and play on it, why, that
would be just too wonderfully grand and splendid for
anything. There were not words in the French language
that could express the pleasure it would give
her. She could not speak of it. It was too good to
talk about.</p>

<p>For several days she thought about it and dreamed
of it and wondered if it would do to tell her father
and ask him to give her a violin. At last the secret
became unbearable and on creeping into her mother&#8217;s
bed before daylight one morning for her regular petting
she ventured to lisp to her mother that she wanted
a violin&mdash;&#8220;a real one, to play upon herself.&#8221;</p>

<p>The morning star faded away quickly, and there
was only the dull grey dawn in the child&#8217;s sky. Her
mother treated her request with laughter and put out
the little Camilla&#8217;s hope with a flat refusal.</p>

<span class="caption">SUNRISE.</span></h2>


<p>It was the town talk. The women gathered round
the fountain in the Place Royal and filled their water
jars and gossiped about Salvatore Urso&#8217;s silly whim with
his child. Madame Dubois settled her cap and gave it
as her opinion that no good would come of such a foolish
thing. Madame Tilsit knew better, if the child wanted
to play, why, let her play. The priest would not forbid
it. Madame Perche knew it was far better than teaching
children to read. That would lead them to dreadful
infidelity, and what not. Besides, what will you?
M. Urso will do as he pleases with the child.</p>

<p>At its best Nantes is a sleepy place, and in those days
it was more narrow, petty and gossipy than can be
imagined. A small town in New England where every
mother&#8217;s daughter can read is bad enough, but in a
compact French town where every one must live next
door or next floor to everybody else gossip runs wild.
Totally ignorant of books or any matter outside of their
own town, the people must needs fall back on themselves
and quietly pick each other to pieces. Everybody
had heard that Salvatore Urso, the flute player
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>intended to teach his little girl the violin. Part of the
town approved of this bold, audacious step and part of
the town thought it eminently improper, if not positively
wicked. There was the Urso party and the anti-Urso
party. They talked and quarrelled over it for a
long time in a fashion that was quite as narrow minded
and petty as could be imagined and it was more than a
year before the excitement subsided.</p>

<p>In the meantime the little Camilla was perfectly
happy over her new violin. The first refusal had not
discouraged her. She waited a few days and then repeated
her request to her father. No. It could not be.
This did not seem to disconcert her, for in a few days
she again asked if she might have a violin and a teacher.
This time the refusal was not so decided. Again
and again did the little one ask for a violin&mdash;only a violin&mdash;that
was enough. The importunate pleading carried
the day and the father took the matter into consideration.</p>

<p>Boys might play the violin, but a girl. That was quite
another thing. One girl had been known to play the
violin. Mlle. Theresa Melanello had played the violin,
why not Camilla? If she wished to play so much it
must be that she had genius. Should it prove true she
might become a famous artist and win a great fortune.
Perhaps, even sooner, much money might come from
the child&#8217;s playing.</p>

<p>Of course the child must at once go to Paris and enter
the Conservatory of music. Paris was a long way
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>off. It would cost a deal of money to get there and
when there, it would cost a deal more to live, and there
was no way of earning anything in Paris. The theatre,
the church and the lessons enabled them to live
tolerably well in Nantes. To give up these things would
be simple folly. It could not be done. The prospect
was brilliant, the way seemed inviting, but it was not
available. In his doubt and perplexity over the matter
M. Urso went to his friend and companion in the
orchestra, Felix Simon. M. Simon played the first
violin at the theatre, and one night they talked it over
between the acts.</p>

<p>If Camilla was so exceedingly anxious to play she
must have some latent talent. Should she prove a
genius or a prodigy it might be the means of bringing
the family a fortune. Paris offered the only field for
instruction and Paris meant a very great deal of money.
With her present limited resources the thing was not
to be considered for a moment.</p>

<p>M. Simon heard it all patiently, talked with the child
about it and before her very eyes turned himself into
an angel by offering to teach her himself. At first the
family could not believe that such good fortune was
possible. Still, it was true. M. Simon would teach
Camilla one year without pay if he might be allowed
to have entire control of her studies. She was to follow
his instructions in every thing, she was to have no
&#8220;pieces&#8221; and was to give her whole time to her lessons.
If, when the year&#8217;s instruction was finished, the child
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>really showed a decided genius for the violin it might
be well to talk about Paris. If she then exhibited
merely a talent for the art, the instruction could be
dropped and no harm or serious loss of time would
come from it.</p>

<p>This liberal offer was, of course, accepted. M. Simon
was a friend, indeed. They could never repay
him. It was of no consequence he said. If Camilla
proved her genius it would be reward enough to be
known as her first teacher.</p>

<p>So it was that the little girl not quite six years of
age had her darling wish and took her beloved violin
under her arm and trotted off to M. Simon&#8217;s house at
the other side of the city near the beautiful park called
the Cours St. Pierre, where she had spent so many
pleasant days playing under the trees.</p>

<p>It was a small affair. Her arms and fingers were
too short for an instrument of the ordinary size and a
little violin costing ten francs ($2) must answer every
purpose.</p>

<p>The gossips might talk and quarrel over it in the
steep streets of the quaint, sleepy old town. They could
say what they pleased. Little did she care. She was
going to learn to play the violin. That was happiness
enough. Her father was to teach her the elements of
music and Felix Simon was to show her how to play.</p>

<p>First she must learn how to stand, how to rest on
her left foot with the right partly in front, then how to
hold her violin, how it should rest on her shoulder and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>how to grasp and support it. Hold it perfectly still for
ten minutes. Then lay it down for a few moments&#8217;
rest. Take it up again and hold it firm. With demure
patience she bent her small fingers over the
strings as if to touch a chord. Head erect, left arm
bent and brought forward so that she could see her elbow
under the violin. Stand perfectly still with the
right arm hanging down naturally. Was she to have
no bow? No, not yet. She must first learn to sustain
the weight of the violin, and accustom her arm to its
shape. In silence and motionless she held the instrument
for perhaps ten minutes and then laid it down again
till she had become rested. This was the first lesson.
For two or three weeks she did this and nothing more,
and at the end of that time she had acquired sufficient
strength to hold the violin with firmness and steadiness.</p>

<p>Great was her delight when Felix Simon said she
might take her bow. Now rest it lightly on the strings
and draw it down slowly and steadily. Not a sound!
What did that mean? Was she not to play? No.
There was no rosin on the bow and it slipped over the
strings in silence. How could she learn anything on a
dumb violin? How make music on such a discouraging
thing?</p>

<p>Most children would have given up in despair. Not
play at all? Nothing, but positions and dumb motions?
That was all. No music; not even finger exercises.
Simply, to learn to stand properly, to put the fingers in
the right place, and to make the right motions with the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>bow. The two hour lesson slipped away quickly, and
the little one went home satisfied that she was now
really making a good start.</p>

<p>Three times a week she took the long walk through
the Rue Voltaire, across the sunny Place Graslin,
where the theatre stood, past the handsome stores in
the Place Royal, over the little bridge, where the
Erdre ran through the town, and then along the narrow
Rue d&#8217;Orleans till the grey towers of the old
Chateau came in sight. Then to M. Simon&#8217;s, and the
lesson on the dumb violin. Not a word of complaint;
no asking for &#8220;little pieces,&#8221; after the silly fashion of
American children; not even a request for an exercise.
With a patience past belief the little one watched,
listened, and tried her girlish best to do it right. The
violin would become dreadfully heavy. Her poor arms
would ache, and her limbs become stiff with standing.
M. Simon had a temper, and at times he was particularly
cross, and said all sorts of unhappy things to her.</p>

<p>Tears at times, and childish grief over the dreadful
weariness in her arms, but with it all not one word of
remonstrance or complaint. Felix Simon knew everything.
Her father knew what was best.</p>

<p>The violin would swing round to the left, and she
would lose sight of her elbow under it. There was
nothing to do but to straighten up till the instrument
stood in a line with her fat little turned up nose, and
that elbow was in sight again. Then, that right wrist!
How it did ache with the long, slow motions with the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>bow. And her limbs grew stiff with standing in one
position till they fairly ached.</p>

<p>If the violin was heavy, she would not mind it, and if
she was tired, she would keep her eyes fixed on the
strings and see that the bow lay flat and square on
them as it went up and down, up and down, from the
tip to the handle, over and over, again and again.
Whatever happened, she would keep on. She was
going to play. This was the way to learn. She would
have patience.</p>

<p>At home the same thing was repeated. Three hours
practice every day with the dumb violin. And not
only every day in the week, Sundays and all, but every
week. Three whole months passed away, and then
they said she had learned the positions, and the right
motions. She could have some rosin on her bow and
begin to play. This was progress. She was really
getting on. Now she was to have some music. Nothing
but the very dullest kinds of exercises; still, it was
music, or something like it.</p>

<p>Long sustained notes by the hour. The exercises
were all written out with a pen by her master. Nothing
but long slow notes. Not very interesting, certainly.
She would not have agreed with you. To get a good
tone, to make one pure, smooth note was worth the trying
for, and she was content.</p>

<p>The bow hardly moved, so slowly did she draw it
up and down. The right arm stretched out to the
full length, and then slowly back again, while the wrist
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>bent slowly and gracefully. If she obtained nothing
else, she would have a strong, clear tone, and learn to
make a grand, full sweep with her bow. Speed and
brilliancy would come in good time. Strength, power,
and purity of tone were the things worth trying to
reach. She would have no feeble, short strokes, but
the wide, bold movements of a master hand.</p>

<p>As the weeks grew to months, her fingers and arms
gained in power and her child&#8217;s violin was exchanged
for a larger and finer one, to her great joy and satisfaction.</p>

<p>Slowly and patiently she crept along. By day and
by night the beloved violin was ever near her. Sometimes
in the morning, sometimes late at night, when
ever her teacher could find the time, she listened to his
instructions and played over the endless exercises.
Seven hours practice every day. Three lessons a week;
nothing allowed to interfere. Sleep, eat, a little exercise
in the open air, practice and lessons, lessons and
practice. Such was her young artist life.</p>

<p>The lessons gradually increased in variety and difficulty.
Scales in every key, running passages of every
imaginable character; and with it all not a single
piece, song, or pretty melody of any kind. Ten
months of finger exercises; nearly a year of dry scales.</p>

<p>As we have already mentioned, Nantes was very
much given to talking about the little Camilla&#8217;s studies.
The men in the orchestra laughed at Felix Simon and
Salvatore Urso for their silly experiment with the child.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>The idea of a girl playing a violin! It was too absurd!
And of all children, that mite of a Camilla; thin, pale,
and too small for her age, she was the last one to think
of such a thing.</p>

<p>One day a famous violinist, Apollinaire DeKonstki,
now the director of the Conservatory of Music, at
Warsaw, visited Nantes, and gave a concert at the
theatre. Perhaps it would be well to ask him to
hear the child play. His opinion might be of great
value, and perhaps it would silence the miserable chatter
in the town. &#8220;Would DeKonstki kindly hear the
little one play?&#8221; Yes. He would, with pleasure.
He intended to give a banquet to some of his friends
that evening, and after the opera, and when the supper
was over, she might come to his rooms at the Hotel de
France. She sat in her usual corner in the orchestra
all through the evening, and then, near midnight, with
her violin under her arm, she crossed the Place Graslin
and called at the Hotel de France. The great artist
was sitting in the dining room by the long table where
the banquet had been given. There were goblets and
champagne glasses on the table, and after talking about
her music for a few moments he took a fork, and gently
tapping on a wine-glass, asked her what note that was.
It was E. And this one? A. And this one? D.
The next? A flat. And the next? G. Round the
table he marched, fork in hand, striking the glasses and
asking their notes. Camilla followed after, and named
every tone correctly and without hesitation. He was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>greatly pleased with the experiment, and said he would
hear her play. &#8220;Only, you must mind, I don&#8217;t like
false notes.&#8221; This was too much, and she replied indignantly
&#8220;I never give &#8217;em, sir.&#8221;</p>

<p>He laughed; and then, with demure seriousness, she
began to play some of her more difficult exercises from
memory. She was a bold and sturdy player, and astonished
the master with the graceful sweep of her
thin, childish arm. He complimented her in a cordial
manner, and hoped she would go on with her studies.
&#8220;Oh! she would, she would; she meant to study all the
time. Some day she would learn to play better still.&#8221;
And then she went home, well pleased that the master
had approved of the method of instruction she had
pursued. Let the gossips talk. She was on the right
road, and she didn&#8217;t care for them.</p>

<p>This was the only time that Camilla played to any
one outside her own family during the first year of her
musical life. Many musicians and others asked to hear
her, but M. Urso thought it best to refuse them. No
one was ever allowed to hear her practice, and her
musical progress was kept a profound secret. Naturally
enough, this only excited curiosity, and the gossip ran
wilder than ever.</p>

<p>Her outward life was unchanged. She appeared
regularly at the theatre with her father, and sat by his
side through the performance. The other players often
teased her, and asked her perplexing questions about
the music. What note was that? What key were
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>they playing in now, and now and now? Every time
the music modulated from key to key, she followed it,
and named the notes and keys correctly, without hesitation.</p>

<p>Then something happened that made them think it
might be well to let her have a piece to play. And
such a splendid piece! Not a mere child&#8217;s song for the
violin, or a little dance. Nothing like that. A grand
concert piece such as the Masters played. De Beriot&#8217;s
famous &#8220;<i>Seventh air vari&eacute;</i>.&#8221; A melody with variations,
by the great composer De Beriot. To be sure it was not
equal to some of the grand works of Haydn or Beethoven,
but for those days it was considered a remarkable
composition. Since the little Camilla has grown
up people have learned more about violin playing, and
what was then thought to be a great piece of music
would not now be considered as anything very remarkable.</p>

<p>As it was, Camilla thought the piece something quite
wonderful, and took it up with the greatest eagerness.
Utterly absorbed in her work, knowing little or nothing
of what was going on outside her lessons, she studied
and practiced day after day without a thought of anything
else. The new piece and the exercises took her
whole time for the next two months. That one &#8220;<i>air
vari&eacute;</i>&#8221; was in hand every day. She played it through
hundreds of times. Every phrase was studied. Hours
were spent over one note. A week on a single page
was good progress. One little passage cost her many a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>sorrowful hour. Somehow she could not get it right
for a long time. Once she played it over forty-seven
times before her nervous and irritable master would let
her off. Other pupils were waiting. They could wait.
She was to play that measure just right if it took all day.
It was useless to cry. If she was obstinate and naughty
about it she should be punished. She must play it
right. How her arms ached over that passage. The
tears dropped on the violin. It didn&#8217;t do any good,
and only made the master still more angry. At last
she did it right, played it over several times, went home
and never played it wrong again in her life.</p>

<p>Such was the child&#8217;s artist life for the first twelve
months. Outside of it the gossips fairly raged and
warred with their nimble tongues. Salvatore Urso&#8217;s
experiment with his little girl was much talked about.
Some could not say too hard things of him. Felix Simon
was blamed, her mother was blamed. It was all wrong.
It was wicked to teach the child to play. Others said
no, let her try, if she failed they would be well punished
for their work. If she succeeded it would be a fine
thing. It was rumored that the girl had great talent
and would in time do wonderful things.</p>

<p>In such a dull, sleepy town as Nantes, where there
is nothing in particular going on, and where the people
have little or nothing to talk about outside their own
petty lives, such an experiment as this was naturally
the subject of much talk. It was such a bold step,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>and, really, there was nothing else to talk about. Imagine
the excitement when it was announced that the
little Camilla would give a public performance at the
Hotel de Ville.</p>

<p>It came about in this way. The Bassoon in the
orchestra died. That was the curious way they expressed
it. The instrument had not died, but the man
who played it. He left a widow and one child, and no
money. Nobody had ever heard of an orchestral player
who had left much. The pay was too small for him to
save anything, and so the poor widow was left without
a franc. Of course, they must give her a benefit concert.
M. Urso heard of it, and on talking it over with
Felix Simon they decided to prepare Camilla to take
part in the charity concert for the benefit of the widow
of the Bassoon. So it happened that she took up the
&#8220;<i>air vari&eacute;</i>&#8221; as her first piece.</p>

<p>It takes a long time to do anything in Europe.
Here we would decide to give a concert, advertise it,
and hire the hall all in the same day, and have it all
over within a week. In Nantes it took six weeks to
arrange everything, see who would offer to play, and to
properly announce the event. This slow and deliberate
way of doing things was an advantage to Camilla as it
gave her plenty of time to study the piece and to commit
it to memory past forgetting.</p>

<p>They collected a grand orchestra. Mdlle. Masson,
who was quite a fine artist volunteered to sing, and the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>little Camilla would play the famous &#8220;<i>Seventh air
vari&eacute;</i>&#8221; from De Beriot.</p>

<p>The excitement was tremendous. Everybody wanted
to go. The Italian opera company, the French opera
company, the dramatic company, all the grand families,
every musician in town, bought tickets. There was
not a seat or standing place in the Hotel de Ville to be
had, and the Bassoon&#8217;s widow received a most remarkable
benefit. All the friends of the Urso family were
there to encourage the child, and all her father&#8217;s enemies
were on hand ready to laugh at her failure.</p>

<p>She was expected to fail. She might be able to
struggle through the piece without really breaking
down, but of course she would stand awkwardly, handle
her bow like a stick, and do everything else that was
bad and inelegant. They might assert that she would
play like an artist&mdash;she could not do it. And so they
waited to see Salvatore Urso&#8217;s silly experiment come
to a wretched end.</p>

<p>How amiable in them! We can forgive them.
There was nothing else to talk about in Nantes, and it
was certainly a very bold thing to bring out the six
year old girl in this public manner. She must be a
truly wonderful child, or her father and teacher had
quite lost their heads.</p>

<p>The concert began and went on very much as concerts
do everywhere. The orchestra played and the
artists sang, and then there was a little rustle and hush
of expectation as they brought in a box or platform for
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>the child to stand upon so that all could see her. The
piano was rolled out into a convenient place, and then
the slight, blue eyed girl, gay in a white dress, white
satin shoes, and a pink sash, appeared. They placed
the dot of a child, violin in hand, upon the raised platform
before them all. Felix Simon, with trembling
fingers, sat down to the piano to play the accompaniment.
Her father stood near to turn the leaves of the
music book, though he was so nervous and excited he
hardly knew what he was about. In the audience sat
her aunt Caroline, surrounded by a few of her friends,
and all of them in no enviable frame of mind. Her
mother was too nervous and excited to appear, and
remained in the ante-room.</p>

<p>As for Camilla, she was absorbed in that remarkable
pink sash and those satin shoes. There was never anything
quite so fine, and she did hope all the people
noticed how very becoming they were. That they
were really watching her, never entered her head.
With perfect self-possession she put the violin to her
shoulder, and stood ready to play. No awkwardness,
no fear, no attempt at display; a simple girl, with a
girl&#8217;s manners. The critics admitted to themselves
that she knew how to hold her instrument, and could
handle her bow with a certain amount of grace. But,
then, that was to be expected. Could she play?</p>

<p>There was not much doubt of it. The tone came,
strong, full, and true. The notes came in exact time,
and with precision and certainty. The people were
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>hushed to a painful silence, as the child went steadily
on with the work. M. Simon was breathless with excitement,
and her father hardly knew where he was.
In his haste, he turned two leaves of the music-book
at once. What a dreadful disaster! It was all over
now. She would break down at once, if the accompaniment
should falter.</p>

<p>Not much danger; for she quietly turned her head,
and in a hurried, lisping, whisper said: &#8220;You&#8217;ve turned
two pages, papa.&#8221;</p>

<p>The whole house heard every word, and a smile
spread over the company. Little did she care. She
went straight on; not a note lost, not a break or a sign
of hesitation. The page was turned back without a
pause, and the music went on.</p>

<p>This piece of music begins with an introduction in
<i>adagio</i>. The opening bars are smooth and graceful,
and then the melody becomes more difficult, and moves
in sixths and thirds. It ends in a brilliant <i>cadenza</i>,
that leads to the theme in <i>moderato</i> time. This part
is not very difficult in rhythm, and is bright and pleasing
in character. The first variation is <i>poco piu lento</i>,
and at once demands great skill to execute its difficult
running movements. The second variation is
still more difficult, and abounds in rapid scales and
open chords. The third variation is in G, and in
<i>adagio</i> time, and is full of trills and abrupt changes
from high to low notes. A long <i>cadenza</i> leads to the
last movement in <i>moderato</i> time and in the key of E.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>It finally ends in an <i>allegro coda</i> that abounds in brilliant
and difficult writing.</p>

<p>What a dreadful uproar they did make over the
child. It seemed as if they never would stop clapping
and cheering. She could not go, but must stay and
bow in a demure fashion, that was perfectly captivating.
They did not expect her to play the piece again. That
was not the custom in Nantes. M. Sollie, the leader
of the orchestra, in the name of all the musicians,
offered to crown her young head with a wreath of
white camelias. The attempt was amusing, and they
all laughed and cheered again. The wreath was too
big, or she was too small, and it slipped over her head
and shoulders, and fell to the floor, and there she stood
in the middle of it.</p>

<p>Some enthusiastic ladies presented her with a tiny
ring for her finger, and a handsome bracelet; and more
wonderful than all, they brought out a magnificent Paris
doll, in a big white box, and set her quite wild with
joy by presenting it to her. With the doll under one
arm, and her precious violin under the other, she bowed
her thanks from the middle of the wreath. Then they
cheered again, and laughed, and offered her flowers.
She was taken down from the platform and led away,
but they had her back again three times, doll, violin,
and all. Altogether, it was a very remarkable experience
for father, mother, teacher, and wonderful
little girl.</p>

<p>Perhaps you think this overdrawn. This is a true
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>story. Here is an extract from one of the newspapers
of Nantes, that only says the same thing:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>&mdash;&mdash;&#8220;Never had violinist a <i>pose</i> more exact, firmer,
and, at the same time, perfectly easy; never was bow
guided with greater precision, than by this little Urso,
whose delivery made all the mothers smile. Listen,
now, to the Air Variee of the celebrated Beriot; under
these fingers, which are yet often busied with dressing
a doll, the instrument gives out a purity and sweetness
of tone, with an expression most remarkable. Every
light and shade is observed, and all the intentions of
the composer faithfully rendered. Here comes more
energetic passages, the feeble child will find strength
necessary, and the voice of the instrument assumes a
fullness of tone which one could not look for in the
diminutive violin. Effects of double stopping, staccato,
rapid arpeggios&mdash;everything is executed with the same
precision, the same purity, the same grace. Repeatedly
interrupted by applause and acclamations, she was
saluted at the end by salvos of bravos and a shower of
bouquets.&#8221;</p></div>

<p>As for the anti-Urso party, they were completely
demoralized and had not a word to say. Camilla was
a success, and they gracefully retired from the field.</p>

<span class="caption">THE DAY BEGINS.</span></h2>


<p>The next morning Camilla trotted off to Felix Simon&#8217;s
just as if nothing had happened. The Ursos
were too sensible to be upset by vanity. The triumph
of their child only caused them to soberly consider
what was to be done next. Camilla must lose no time.
The lessons must go on precisely as before and until
matters were properly arranged her life would be
unchanged. She must prepare for more difficult tasks.
Having proved her skill she must now improve it.
Greater tests and severer trials were in store for
her. She must go to Paris. She must enter the Conservatory
of Music. But how, and when?</p>

<p>Long and earnestly they talked over the matter and
laid their plans as best they could. M. Urso was a fine
flute player. Of course, he could readily obtain a place
in some theatre in Paris. Camilla&#8217;s mother was a
charming singer and a good teacher. She could give
lessons, and perhaps sing in some church. Oh! and
then there was the organ! Certainly so fine an organist
as M. Urso would soon get a good place with a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>comfortable salary. Aunt Caroline must go too. She
would keep house and help the children. None of
them had ever been to Paris, but the prospect seemed
brilliant and for Camilla&#8217;s sake they ought to go as soon
as possible. Having decided to move they sold all
their furniture, collected whatever was due for music
lessons and salaries and prepared for the flitting.</p>

<p>Camilla, her father and aunt Caroline were to go
first. The baby brother was too young to bear the
journey, and when they were comfortably settled in
Paris, mother could follow them. The journey was a
slow one. It was mid-summer, and on the road came
the news that the cholera was raging in Paris. It
would not do to enter the city till cooler weather came.
So they tarried at Tours for six weeks till the sickness
abated.</p>

<p>The Conservatory of Music stood at the corner of the
Rue Faubourg&mdash;Poissoni&egrave;re and the Rue Berg&egrave;re in the
old part of the city of Paris. They must take rooms
as near it as possible so that Camilla would not have
too far to walk on stormy days. With all their hopeful
prospects and though they had quite a large sum of
ready money in hand they took simple quarters in
a house on the Rue St. Nicholas d&#8217;Antin.</p>

<p>As soon as they were comfortably settled Salvatore
Urso went to the conservatory to ask if the little Camilla
might be admitted as a pupil.</p>

<p>The Director, Auber, received him politely and asked
what he wanted. &#8220;Could Camilla enter the Conservatory?&#8221;
The little shrivelled up gentleman opened his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>small eyes as wide as he could and said, in a squeaking
voice, &#8220;Camilla! That&#8217;s a girl!&#8221; Yes. Camilla was
a girl. How very shocking in her. Why was she not a
boy? A girl. Oh! No it couldn&#8217;t be considered for
a moment. A girl enter the great Conservatory of
Music! Such a thing had never been heard of in the
whole history of the world. The Conservatory was
not for girls and they couldn&#8217;t be admitted.</p>

<p>This was discouraging and M. Urso retired from the
interview not knowing what to do next. The idea
that the great composer Auber would utterly refuse to
take the child had never entered his head. Of course,
with her undoubted genius the Conservatory would be
proud to teach her. What difference did it make if
she did happen to be a girl?</p>

<p>It made a great deal of difference to the worthy
officers of the Conservatory. Not one of them would
consider her case. The Secretary, De Beauchesne was
applied to with more success, but he was only one of
the officers and he could do nothing alone. He heard
Camilla play and did everything he could for her. He
visited the family and was in every way a friend.
When Camilla&#8217;s third brother, Salvatore, was born, he
stood Godfather to the child, so we may infer that he
was quite intimate at the Ursos&#8217;.</p>

<p>It would not do to give it up so. Day after day
slipped past, the time grew to weeks and still the doors
of the Conservatory were fast closed against the child.
M. Urso called on Auber several times. Would he not
interest himself in the child? Would he only hear her
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>play? No. It was useless. She was a girl. She
could not enter. Why had M. Urso been so foolish as
to come to Paris when he might have known that they
never took in girls. Besides, she was not old enough.
Not even a boy could enter under ten.</p>

<p>People of influence were consulted, and in vain. If
the Directors of the Conservatory would not take the
child it was no affair of theirs. They could do nothing
about it. It did seem as if everything was against
her and she began to realize what a very unhappy thing
it is to be a girl. Still, she would not despair nor relax
one effort to obtain her darling wish. She would keep
on studying just the same and all through the weary
weeks of waiting she practiced and studied as best she
could under her father&#8217;s instruction.</p>

<p>The Winter passed away and the Spring came.
It brought very little hope with it. Camilla could
not enter the Conservatory. There were only nine
places and there were seventy-six applicants and every
one of them boys. When they grew up they could
play in the theatres. That was the aim of their lives.
The Conservatory was opened to teach them, to prepare
them for this very work. Camilla would not play
in an orchestra and, of course, she would be of no
use to the country and it was idle to admit her to the
classes.</p>

<p>Persistence finally carried the day. M. Urso fairly
worried the learned officers of the Conservatory into a
consent. The irritable little Director, Auber, lost his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>temper and said &#8220;Well, bring the girl. She is sure to
fail. We will hear her play, but she cannot enter.&#8221;</p>

<p>The Ursos were greatly pleased with this concession.
If they would hear Camilla just once it would be
enough. They could hardly refuse to take a child of
her great talents even if she did have the misfortune
to be a girl.</p>

<p>At last the eventful day arrived. The seventy-six
boys and the one girl were to be examined. Her case
was quite hopeless, they said. She might play like an
angel and it would avail nothing. The boys would
have the places.</p>

<p>She never lost her courage, but with that quiet, serious
manner that only served to hide her sturdy character,
she took her father&#8217;s hand and soberly trotted
through the streets without a fear. She knew what
she could do, she had her piece by heart; she meant to
break into that Conservatory, it was her only hope and
she would try hard to do her very, very best.</p>

<p>M. Urso was excited and nervous. How would it all
end? Would Camilla be admitted. It was doubtful,
still, her genius might win the day in spite of the determined
opposition that was raised against her. As for
Camilla she clung to her violin in stubborn silence, and
patiently waited for the great trial. All the candidates
met in one room, the seventy-six boys and their friends
and the one girl with her father.</p>

<p>All the names were numbered and the numbers
placed in a box and shaken up. Then, some one drew
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>them out, one at a time, and called off the numbers.
Camilla&#8217;s number was nine, so her turn came quite early
in the day. This was fortunate, for she was fresh
and eager to begin and the jury had not become weary
with their task. One at a time the boys were admitted
to the presence of the grand jury. Big fellows,
fourteen and fifteen years old, who had played before
she was born. The case really looked discouraging
and desperate. Would she ever get in? She was
only seven, and looked hardly six. Her fingers were
thin and her face pale. She hardly seemed fitted to
compete with grown up lads. It did not deter her from
trying, and when her number was called she felt sure
she would do her best.</p>

<p>They led her into a room where eight solemn looking
men sat in big green-backed chairs round a large table.
Each had an inkstand and pen and paper and every
one had a look of severe dignity that was positively
appalling. There was the little Auber, the Director,
Rossini the great composer looking fat and grand in his
impressive wig, Carraffa the celebrated composer, Allard
the violinist and four others looking equally wise
and solemn.</p>

<p>They placed her before the double quartette of players
who were to give the accompaniment and prepared
to hear her work. She would try the <i>andante</i> and
<i>finale</i> from the <i>Fourth Concerto</i>, by Rode with accompaniment
for violin, second, viola, and violincello.</p>

<p>Here was her one grand chance. She must do her
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>very best, stand just right, and remember everything
Felix Simon had said. Her father and mother depended
upon her.</p>

<p>The double quartette began to play and she forgot
everything save the music. The solemn judges never
spoke, nor made a sign in any way expressive of
pleasure or disappointment. Some of them scratched
their pens over the paper through it all. Others
looked straight at her in a severe manner that was perfectly
dreadful.</p>

<p>At last it was over. The eight gentlemen never
smiled or uttered a word or gave even a look that
seemed like hope. She couldn&#8217;t guess whether she had
failed or won. Somebody led her back to her father
in the room where the seventy and six boys were still
waiting the result of the trial.</p>

<p>Those men looked so black and really it was all so
grim and solemn that she was depressed and discouraged
and for six long hours she sat in the room by her father
waiting for the verdict to be pronounced. It was
eleven o&#8217;clock in the morning when her turn came and
it was not till five in the afternoon when the last boy
had been heard.</p>

<p>There was a tremendous excitement when the Janitor
came out to read the names of the nine successful
ones. Every one sat perfectly still while the names
were pronounced. First a boy&#8217;s name. She expected
that and was resigned. Then another boy&#8217;s name was
given. It began to be discouraging. Then one more
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>boy&#8217;s name. Her chances were slipping away. She
would not be taken in. One more boy&#8217;s name. There
were murmurs of disappointment from the crowd.
Half the names gone. Poor Camilla was ready to cry
with disappointment.</p>

<p>Just here Allard, one of the jury passed through the
room and stopping a moment said to Camilla&#8217;s father:</p>

<p>&#8220;The little Urso is admitted.&#8221;</p>

<p>Nobody could believe it! There was some mistake!
That mite of a girl taken in? The four remaining
names given by the Janitor were hardly heard in the
uproar and confusion that broke out. The boys who
had failed and even their friends were for mobbing the
child. It was dreadful, an outrage, perfectly unheard
of, a shame, and all that. What right had a girl to
come and take the place away from some good boy
who could undoubtedly play much better? M. Urso
had used influence with the jury and done many wicked
things to bring about this unheard of result.</p>

<p>M. Urso threw up his hat in the air, behaved in a
wild and happy manner and gave no heed to the taunts
of the people. He gave Camilla a ten franc gold piece
and conducted himself in a startling and peculiar
fashion generally that would have astonished his friends
had they seen him. As for Camilla her mind was absorbed
in that gold piece. She had never seen anything
quite so magnificent. Here were riches, indeed,
and she didn&#8217;t care a pin for the silly boys who stormed
and roared about her. What a noise they did make
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>over it! &#8220;Stupid boys, they couldn&#8217;t play, and that
was the reason they were so mad about it.&#8221; She must
go home and show her prize to her aunt. How glad
her mother would be to hear of her success. Hugging
her violin close she paid no attention to the rude people
in the room and silently suffered her father to lead
her away.</p>

<p>It was a happy day for the Ursos. To think that
the little one had fairly broken down the bars of the
Conservatory and compelled them to take her in
by the simple strength of her genius. Soon after her
mother joined them from Nantes and the reunited family
was indeed a happy one.</p>

<p>Since that time several girls have been admitted to
the Paris Conservatory, but they have to thank Camilla,
the youngest of them all, for clearing the way.</p>

<p>Now she began to think that all the weary months
with the dumb violin, the long hours of practice, the
days and nights spent with dear, cross, old Felix Simon
were happily rewarded. With all the elation and pride
of her parents she seemed only to be glad, in a quiet
way, that she could now go on and learn more and
more.</p>

<p>Many weeks must pass before the long summer vacation
would be over and the Fall term of the school begin.
In the meantime not a day was lost. Three or
four hours practice every morning with her father,
a walk after dinner, and then two hours more practice.
No pieces. Nothing but exercises in long, slow notes
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>to keep up the strong, pure tone, and scales in every
key.</p>

<p>There is nothing so successful as success. Just as
the vacation was nearly over the little Camilla had
another most flattering offer of instruction. De Beriot,
whose music she had played at the concert at Nantes,
visited Paris and gave several concerts. While he
was in the city M. Urso called upon him and asked
permission to bring Camilla to his room. Yes. He
would gladly hear her play. This was certainly a
great favor and soon after she went to his hotel and
played some of his music to him. He was greatly
pleased with the child and at once offered to take her
to Brussels where he lived, and give her a complete
musical education at his own expense. He was at that
time the first teacher of the violin at the Conservatory
of music at Brussels, a place that is now filled by
Vieuxtemps, and he was certainly a master of the violin.
He would do this freely if he might have entire
control of her education. She was not to appear in
public till he was quite ready. It might not be for
many years. To be sure, in three years, by the time
she was ten, she would be a wonderful player, but by
waiting longer she would become one of the few great
violinists of the world.</p>

<p>This was indeed generous. They were thankful and
would be delighted to place her under his instruction
if they could go too, and be near her all the time.
They had no means of supporting her in another city.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>She could not leave father and mother. They already
found it difficult to get along. Paris seemed very different
from their anticipations. It was hard to decline
such a splendid offer, but it was harder to part with
Camilla, and she could not go.</p>

<p>Then came the Conservatory. There were several
teachers of the violin. She might have the choice, and
decided to go into Lambert Massart&#8217;s class. He was
the most popular teacher. He was known to be cross
and irritable. His pupils had a sorry time of it but
they generally became good artists. She meant to be
an artist and she would go to him. It was fortunate,
for as soon as he heard her play and learned something
of her history and circumstances, he generously offered
to give her private lessons at his own house without
money and without price.</p>

<p>&#8220;Heaven helps those who help themselves.&#8221; Salvatore
Urso saw his store of money melting away fast.
It was not easy to find a place in the orchestras in Paris.
There was not a church in the city that did not
have several applicants waiting for the position of organist.
Evil days were beginning to come upon them.
Nearly nine months had slipped away and Camilla had
only just succeeded in entering the Conservatory. For
all that, she had entered and her talents had won a
good friend in the great teacher Massart. They had no
noble patron to aid them, there was no wealthy friend
to help them along. Everything depended upon themselves
and Camilla. She, brave little girl had done
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>well and could now go on and fulfill her splendid destiny.</p>

<p>Her first lesson at the Conservatory opened her eyes
to the life that was before her. There were eight boys
in Massart&#8217;s class besides herself. At first the boys
sneered at her and resented her presence. Not content
with this they tried to annoy her with rudeness
and to plague her with boyish pranks. She took it all
patiently, replied to nothing and clung to her violin in
stubborn silence.</p>

<p>Massart was a large, rosy faced man with an uncertain
temper. He seemed much younger than he really
was, and though at times he was dreadfully cross and
savage, he was at heart a kind and generous man.
His manner of teaching was peculiar. One pupil
played at a time and the rest looked on in silence
while the master walked up and down the room with a
long slender stick in his hand. At first she thought it
was a baton to beat time with or to point to the music.
Presently she found it had quite another use. One
stupid boy did not take the proper position. Massart
told him how to stand and the boy put his feet in the
right place. Presently he changed one foot and down
come the stick with a snap on the boy&#8217;s legs. &#8220;Oh!
M. Massart that hurt&#8221; cried the boy. &#8220;I meant it
should,&#8221; said he. &#8220;Do it right next time.&#8221;</p>

<p>If, thought Camilla, that is the way, I&#8217;ll remember
it. Somehow it was not so easy. Massart gave a
direction once and then came the stick. They must
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>do it right once and for all. Before she knew it there
was a slap on her own limbs. It didn&#8217;t hurt much
because her skirts warded off the blow. As for the
boys they had to take it sharp and heavy.</p>

<p>Then that little finger on her right hand. It would
spring up as she moved the bow. Massart said very
pleasantly that she must keep it down. She put it down
but presently it flew up again and then came a stinging
blow from the slender stick that was not so pleasant.</p>

<p>That poor little finger had a sorry time of it before
it would lay down properly. Many a time it ached
with the blows of the switch, and once she thought it
was certainly broken. She was obliged to nurse it in
a cot for two days. At last it came just right and has
never gone wrong since.</p>

<p>Some days Massart was in a terrible passion and
stormed up and down the room, and the stick danced
about the boys legs till the little Camilla felt sore all
over, out of pure sympathy. It made her very cautious
and careful and as a natural result she escaped
much of the shower of blows that the master offered so
freely. One day a stupid boy persisted in holding his
violin wrong and suddenly it flew up to the ceiling in a
hundred fragments. Poor Camilla fairly cried with
fright when the master kicked it out of the pupil&#8217;s
hands and really had to take refuge in sudden tears.
She clung to her instrument with might and main after
that. He would not be able to kick it away in that
style from her hands.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>Up early in the morning, breakfast, then three hours
practice at home with her father, then to her lessons
from two till four at the Conservatory. Then home
again to study till bed time. Such was her day.</p>

<p>Three times a week, at all sorts of hours, as happened
to be convenient, she went to Massart&#8217;s house for
the extra lessons he gave her as a private pupil. He
was a famous teacher and pupils gladly paid him twenty
francs an hour for instruction on the violin. Camilla
had it all for nothing. It was the only gift she
ever did have. Nobody had ever given her money.
They gave her an education and that was worth more
than money. She must work hard and show that she
appreciated the master&#8217;s kindness.</p>

<p>Besides these lessons, she studied harmony and practiced
solfeggio at the Conservatory. Her every hour
was taken up with something. When her fingers were
weary with playing she could write out her exercises
in harmony.</p>

<p>So the days and weeks slipped away. Busy over
her studies she hardly noticed that the winter had come
again till she began to need warmer clothing. She
went to aunt Caroline. Mother was busy on some embroidery.
It was strange how much time mother gave
to that work now. She had not done so at Nantes.
Aunt Caroline gave her an old dress that had been
mended several times. Camilla put it on without remark.
She thought it odd, that there was no new
dress for the winter but said nothing. Somehow things
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>seemed to be changed. Her father was discouraged
and her mother never went out, and worked hard all
day at embroidery. What had happened? She could
not tell.</p>




<h2><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span><a name="CHAPTER_I_IV" id="CHAPTER_I_IV"></a>CHAPTER IV.<br />

<span class="caption">THE WOLF GROWLS.</span></h2>


<p>It was a busy life for Camilla. As the winter advanced
her hours of study increased. More practice
at home and more difficult lessons at the school.
Studies from Rode, Baillot, Fiorillo, Viotti, Kreutzer,
Sporha and the great masters of the violin, were taken
up in turn. It was designed that she should become
acquainted with all the master works of the day. In
addition to regular studies in scales, finger exercises
and the like, she went through all the works of the
masters that she might become familiar with their
style and learn to appreciate the best art. There were
no trifling songs, no silly pieces designed to show how
fast she could scrabble through a great many notes.
Nothing of this kind allowed. Solid work, grand concertos,
sonatas and solos passed under her hand in review
and in an artistic atmosphere, she began to grow
to the stature of an artist while only a child.</p>

<p>The boys in the class soon laid aside their rude manners
and forgot their jealousy in admiration. Massart
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>laughed at them and said: &#8220;Fie! Boys! The hen is
beating the roosters.&#8221; Much truth was hidden in the
master&#8217;s pleasantry. Camilla was rapidly distancing
them all. She was the favorite scholar. She had the
advantage of Massart&#8217;s private instruction three times
a week and exhibited an aptitude for the work that advanced
her quickly to the head of the class. This was
an honor, for it must be remembered, that these boys
had been selected as the cream of all the candidates.
Each had displayed marked talent for the violin. Had
it been otherwise they would not have been in the
Conservatory.</p>

<p>All were like Camilla, quite poor. Some were even
supported by pensions from their native towns, and
nearly all of them afterwards became good players.
There was Lacham, Leon Regni&eacute;r, and Isidor Lotto
who afterwards became so famous, and several others.</p>

<p>Henri Wieniawski was in the class before Camilla,
but at the time was still about the school. They often
met and there began a friendship that has continued
to this day. Of Massart&#8217;s pupils, three, Camilla, Lotto
and Wieniawski have become famous the world over
and are among the great artists now living.</p>

<p>Besides her regular studies Massart advised Camilla
to join a quartette in order to perfect herself in reading
music at sight. Once a week she spent an hour or two
in playing with three others at the Conservatory and in
this way heard much fine music and accustomed her
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>young eyes to read the notes quickly and taught her
slender fingers to interpret the music at command.</p>

<p>Not all of her days were happy. Massart was
dreadfully cross at times. He would detect the slightest
flaw in the work. Once he marched a stupid boy
out of the room by the ear and told him never to come
back again. If she should be treated like that it would
really break her heart. She would try her best to attend
to all that was said and to do everything just
right. Massart might storm and rage about the room,
but it should not be from any neglect on her part.
Altogether it was not a very lovely life. Try as hard
as she could it did not always please, and some days it
was really pretty tough for such a very small girl.</p>

<p>Another trouble came. Mother would bend over
that dreadful embroidery all day long, and things did
not seem so prosperous as in Nantes. Father was busy
looking about for new rooms and almost before Camilla
was aware of it they were ready for a change of residence.</p>

<p>They could not afford the rent of the rooms on the
Rue St. Nicholas d&#8217;Antin, and they found cheaper
quarters in a flat just under the roof in an old house
on the Rue Lamartine, and up six flights of long, dark
stairs.</p>

<p>It was a sad change from their comfortable home in
sunny Nantes. There was nothing to be seen out of
the windows save steep, red roofs, the sky, and sundry
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>wild cats that roamed over the tiles. The streets thereabouts
were narrow and crooked, with mean little sidewalks
hardly wide enough for one.</p>

<p>It was not the Paris of to-day. The wide and handsome
Rue de La Fayette that now passes near the Rue
Lamartine and the beautiful Square Montholon with its
trees and gardens was not in existence then. Camilla
first knew Paris as a city of short, crowded streets
lined with tall houses and cheap shops and crowded
with work people and small householders.</p>

<p>They had only been settled in the new home a few
weeks when a greater trouble came to them. The wolf
began to growl in the echoing entry way of the tall
house. They began to think he would climb the stairs
or come in over the tiles and scare even the starved
cats away.</p>

<p>The store of money they had brought from dear, old
Nantes had melted away long ago. There was &#8220;little
to earn and many to keep.&#8221; M. Urso tried and tried,
but could get no permanent position at any of the
theatres. There were scores of flute players in the
city. As for organists, there were a dozen for every organ.
Once in a while he had a chance to play for a
single Sunday, as a substitute. Occasionally there was
a party or other gathering where a few francs could be
earned by playing.</p>

<p>Even mother had to help. At Nantes she had spent
many a happy hour in fancy needle-work and embroidery.
In Paris the work was followed for twelve hours
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>a day that she might earn two francs and so help keep
that terrible wolf from coming up the stairs. Aunt
Caroline kept house and made the children&#8217;s clothing
go as far as possible. All helped as well as they could.
They must stay in Paris. Camilla must keep on at the
Conservatory. There were two years more of study before
her. She had put her hand to the plow and could
not turn back. They must all stay and help her through.</p>

<p>The Winter passed away and the Spring came.
Absorbed in her studies Camilla hardly noticed it except
to observe that her thin clothing was more comfortable.
It cost less to live in the Summer, and when
in June her ninth birth-day came and she was eight
years old, they became more hopeful. Perhaps they
could pull through after all.</p>

<p>It was in vain. With the Summer came the dull
times in business and their case grew more and more
desperate. There was no wealthy friend near to help
them. No grand Prince stood ready to pay the bills,
after the fashion of the good Prince who helped the
young Haydn on in his studies. They had not a single
rich friend in the world.</p>

<p>Camilla might get on very well through the warm
weather with her present suit. But, to study or practice
she must have good food and plenty of it. She
looked pale and pinched enough, poor child, and her
dress was too small for comfort. Something must be
done or they would all starve. They must take her
away from the Conservatory or find more money.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>In their distress they applied to Massart and the
officers of the Conservatory. The master was very angry.
&#8220;What! Go away for six months! Give concerts!
It was a shame to lose so much time just when she was
doing so well.&#8221;</p>

<p>No. If Camilla left the Conservatory she could not
come back. That is what they said. And so it was
all over and this was the wretched end of all their trying.
It was hard to give up. What could they do?
The Summer term was almost over. The summer vacation
was at hand. Camilla might give a few concerts
during the vacation. The money might help
them along another winter and then they would be in
want again. The vacation would not give them time
to accomplish all they wished. They hoped by making
an extended tour to earn enough money to support
them a year or more.</p>

<p>It was the only thing to be done and after making
proper representation to the authorities of the Conservatory
permission was given. Camilla might be absent
six months and then resume her place in the classes.
This was a great concession. Only Camilla&#8217;s undoubted
genius, her desire to study, and her poverty
caused them to break over their rules in this matter.
Massart too, gave his consent and said he would resume
her instruction without charge when she returned.</p>

<p>Now she was to prove what she could do. It was a
pity to interrupt her studies. Her education was not
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>half finished and she must appear in public before she
was really ready. If she succeeded now, how great
would be her triumph when the three years at the Conservatory
were finished.</p>

<p>It was impossible to break up the family, and the entire
household prepared for the expedition. As they
had no money they must move slowly and cautiously.
Salvatore Urso would play the flute and accompany Camilla
on the piano. Her mother could sing. That
would make three performers, and with two pieces for
each they could give quite a programme. To make a
variety they should have one more singer. So they
hired a gentleman to join their Company and sing buffo
and other songs. Aunt Caroline would stay in Paris
with the boys. When all was ready Camilla and her
father and mother packed up and started off in search
of fame and money. They must do something, and
this seemed the most feasible plan.</p>

<p>The first journey was a short one and they landed at
the town of Verdun. As soon as they were comfortably
settled in lodgings Camilla and her father started
out to present their letters of introduction. These letters
were to wealthy amateurs who might be interested
in the child and her playing.</p>

<p>The good people received them politely and after
they had made a short call they were formally invited
to call soon and spend the evening with a few musical
friends. This was all that was wanted. If the ladies
and gentlemen once heard Camilla play they would be
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>pleased and perhaps they would take tickets to her
concert. Things move slowly in France and several
days, perhaps a week, would pass before the musical
party would come off. In the mean time Camilla lost
not an hour. From six to ten hours a day she went
through her exercises and studied such pieces as she
intended to perform in public. Her father was constantly
with her, guiding her studies, overlooking her
practice and aiding her in every way possible.</p>

<p>When the important evening came her long, brown
hair was braided in two long braids and secured with
bows of blue ribbon. With her new frock and simple
manners, large blue eyes and thin, pale face she presented
an interesting appearance. A little too quiet
and sober for such a young girl. She seldom spoke,
and was reserved and thoughtful. Her life had not
been a very happy one. Had it not been for her intense
love for music, had her heart not been bound up
in her violin it would have been a sad, dull life, full of
toil and wearisome labor. In after years, when the
showers that fell so steadily during her younger days,
cleared away, the bright, animated and merry side of
her nature came out and the demure little girl became
a vivacious and sparkling woman.</p>

<p>It was small wonder that the two or three hundred
people who met to hear her play were delighted. She
seemed so earnest, her large eyed intensity of expression,
the bold and striking method of playing, the masterly
sweep of her bow captivated and charmed them
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>all. She gave such pieces from memory as she
thought most pleasing and then after some little conversation
about her music they asked if she would give
a concert in Verdun. Yes, in a few days. Would they
not take some tickets? Oh! with the greatest pleasure.
They would all attend and bring their friends.
Were the tickets ready? Yes. Her father had them.
So they crowded round her father and bought some
ten, some twenty, some fifty, and some a hundred. So
most of the tickets were taken at once and success was
secured in advance.</p>

<p>To American eyes this seems a strange fashion. The
idea of playing at a private house and then selling the
tickets strikes us as peculiar and perhaps unpleasant.</p>

<p>The Ursos did not think so. It was the custom of
the country. It is the custom now. All the great
players and singers have taken just such steps as this
and it seems quite proper and so no one thinks ill of
them.</p>

<p>Then she took her violin again. Felix Simon knew
what he was about in Nantes. Massart&#8217;s instructions
had not been thrown away. Camilla was an artist
in little. If she had not the expression and feeling
that comes with maturity, her playing was brilliant,
strong and powerful. The tones were pure and steady
and technical difficulties seemed to be of no consequence.
She went through it all without effort and as
easily and gracefully as can be imagined.</p>

<p>The audience was charmed with her simple manners
and her wonderful playing. They fairly overwhelmed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>her with endearments and attentions. Was there any
thing they could do to gratify such a dear little girl?
One offered her one thing, another something else.
She had a delightful lunch with her new friends and at
last went home laden with bon bons and presents.</p>

<p>Then she must give a concert. They would ask all
their friends and really it would be quite a grand affair.
Of course all this took time. There was the permission
of the Mayor to be obtained, and the hall to be
engaged, the tickets to be prepared, and posters and
advertisements to be sent out and tickets to be sold
among the rich families of the town.</p>

<p>Her father must attend to it all. There was no one
to help and he had to attend to everything.</p>

<p>In a few days the concert came off at one of the
small halls in the town. There was &#8220;a good house,&#8221;
as they say. Camilla played the violin while her father
played the accompaniment on the piano. Her mother
sang and the buffo singer gave some of his songs.
The great attraction was the pale little one with the
long braids. How she raced through the rapid passages
and drew her wonderful bow with a great sweep
that made the tones roll out full and grand. Then those
strange, airy harmonies made by pressing one finger
firmly on a string to give one note and then lightly
touching the same string a fifth above so that the lower
note was partially obscured by the note above it.
Double stopping they call it. We know it as harmonics.
With either name it is difficult enough for even
a man&#8217;s hand. It was small wonder that the people
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>cheered and cried bravo! bravo! and threw flowers
on the stage and actually filled her arms with comfits
and bon bons. Verdun was a great place for sugared
sweets and candied fruits and they thought they were
doing quite the proper thing by presenting some to
her.</p>

<p>The next day they counted the money, paid all the
few small bills and found that they had four hundred
francs left. Really! Things were looking up. Their
prospects were improving. Camilla was certainly a
great success. Collecting such letters of introduction
as they could obtain, they packed up and started
for the next town on their programme. Where was
the wolf now? Nobody knew. Camilla had driven
him away with her violin.</p>




<h2><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span><a name="CHAPTER_I_V" id="CHAPTER_I_V"></a>CHAPTER V.<br />

<span class="caption">A GOOD FIGHT.</span></h2>


<p>Then a short journey to Bar le Duc. As soon as
they were comfortably settled in the new place the
whole ceremony was repeated. The good friends they
had found at Verdun gave them letters of introduction
to the best people and in about three weeks they had
made their calls, played at some of the grand houses
and given a concert with the same interesting result in
the way of good, sound francs. How they treasured
up the little Camilla&#8217;s winnings. Every franc must be
saved and they lived as cheaply and simply as possible at
all times. Every centime would be needed to carry Camilla
through the two more years at the Conservatory.</p>

<p>Then to Metz and Strasburg and to the Rhine. It
was to be a grand tour. The Germans must hear Camilla
play. They were true lovers of music. If they
were pleased it would be a great triumph and the concerts
would be very successful. From Strasburg they
went to Manheim, then up the Rhine to Bale in Switzerland.
Then back again to Baden Baden, and to
Heidelberg.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>What a glorious time she had. There were rides
and walks among the beautiful hills just as the grapes
were ripe. Her spirits became more animated and
childlike and her color returned. It was like some
strange dream. Mother, too was happier, and as for
father he had never been so gay and merry since they
left Nantes. How that pile of francs had grown.
From hundreds it had become thousands.</p>

<p>At Heidelberg she had a ride on the donkeys and
visited the ruined castle high on the hill. It seemed a
kind of continual picnic. It was no longer a weariness
to practice. The weeks flew away so happily that
they hardly noticed that the Fall was near. They
must return to Paris soon. The vacation was over
long ago. Still, the handsome pile of francs was not
large enough yet, and they kept on to Calsrue and
Homburg. Every where it was the same. Presents
of every imaginable kind, flowers and jewelry were
showered upon her. At one place they gave her more
preserves and sugared fruits than she could eat in
a month, and a German Countess at Manheim was so
charmed with the child that she took off a beautiful
pearl cross and chain and put it round Camilla&#8217;s neck.
It was the cross the lady had when she was confirmed
at Church and she valued it highly on that account.
Camilla kept the beautiful present for a long time till
it was lost in New York, as we shall see later in the
story.</p>

<p>The tour was really not a very extensive one. A
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>part of Eastern France and a part of the Rhine country
was all she saw, but it took seven long months to
get through with it. Were she to undertake the tour
now it could be done in two weeks. They had no active
agent traveling ahead to hire the halls and secure
the rooms at the hotels. There were no advertising facilities,
and no telegraphs. M. Urso had to do everything
himself. The ceremonious calls upon the great
families took a great deal of time. The subscription
list and the sale of tickets could not be started till they
were fairly settled in the town. Three weeks in one
city was hardly enough time to prepare for one concert
and during it all Camilla&#8217;s practice could not be neglected
for a single day. Her father was always present
watching and guiding her, and, in fact keeping her
steadily to her work.</p>

<p>To off-set all this, it cost them very little to live,
and their concert expenses were light. The rent of
the halls was low, and they had very few advertising
bills to pay. This made it easy to make the tour profitable,
and when at last they returned to Paris they
found they had 5,000 francs on hand, more money than
they had ever dreamed about in sleepy old Nantes.
This represented Camilla&#8217;s first earnings. Aunt Caroline
had received part of the money to help along the
little home in the Rue Lamartine and when they came
back she stood ready to welcome them at the top of
the six flights of stairs. The cats were all there on the
red roofs, but that wolf had run away in dismay. It is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>thought he did not appreciate music. Camilla was
sure he did not like her style of bowing.</p>

<p>The very next day after the journey was over Camilla
returned to the little room in the corner of the
Conservatory and took her place by the window that
looked out into the court-yard where the school bell
hung in its tower, where she could see fat and rosy Massart
tramp up and down the floor and scold the boys in
his dear, cross old fashion. That stick flourished about
as lively as ever. Her own fingers and limbs felt it once
in a while when she became careless. It was not often
now. She would be nine next Spring. She was getting
to be a big girl and knew too much to be caught
napping by Massart. The &#8220;German Tour&#8221; as she
proudly called it had sharpened her wits and made her
even more attentive and careful. She took up her
studies in solfeggio and harmony and settled down into
the routine of hard, persistent study with renewed vigor.
Those boys were far ahead of her. Never mind.
She would catch them presently.</p>

<p>When we see Madam Urso play to-day we think her
steadiness of posture and grace of playing very easy.
None can count the days, months and years of trial
and labor she spent to attain such skill and grace. In
playing it may be noticed that she stands very firm
and erect on her left foot, with the right slightly advanced
in front. Even so simple a matter as this cost
weeks of painful effort and many a bitter tear. They
put her right foot into a china saucer in such a way that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>the slightest weight upon it would crush it. She broke
several before she fully acquired the proper position.
It cost tears and china ware, at first. Now it is as
nothing.</p>

<p>The playing appears to be easy enough to spectators.
Her fingers fly over the strings with unerring certainty.
It seems as if it would be impossible to go wrong. We
look on the strings to see if there are finger prints, or
other marks to show where the strings should be
touched. There is nothing. On the piano each key is
plainly marked out. Knowing the notes and the keys
we may in time touch them with absolute certainty.
On the violin, the fingers must find the right place
without assistance. The notes must be found, as it
were, in the dark. Only by learning just how far to
stretch the fingers and by the employment of years and
years of practice can any degree of skill be obtained.</p>

<p>In spite of all this, here was our nine year old Camilla
getting ready to compete for the prizes at the end
of her second year. It was not to be a mere concert
where each pupil was to come out and play such pieces
as they liked before a mixed audience. There was a
long difficult concerto, to be learned, and each was to
play the same piece before the severe and critical jury,
and before such musicians and others as chose to attend.
It was held in the theatre attached to the Conservatory.
Besides that, there were three difficult questions to answer
in harmony, and a piece of music written in a most
extraordinary manner was to be sung at first sight.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>In this country we now write vocal music in two
clefs, known as the bass and treble clefs. This makes
it easy to read and any singer after having mastered
them both can get along without much difficulty.
Some of the more lazy ones think it hard to sing
in even one and are quite upset if they try to sing in
any, save their own. What would the poor alto who
&#8220;didn&#8217;t know anything about the bass clefs&#8221; think of
singing at first sight in seven different clefs. Camilla&#8217;s
trial piece at the examination in solfeggio was a song
that began in one clef, went a few bars and then
jumped into another, then into another and back again,
then another and so on in a manner perfectly bewildering
and distracting. She had never seen it before and
went through it without missing a note. The result
was that she carried off the first diploma, and the jury
and audience were greatly pleased.</p>

<p>Then they placed a large basket before her in which
were hundreds of bits of folded paper. She was to
take out three, open them, read them aloud and give a
verbal answer to each. The first question was something
about the relative minor of a certain major key
and its signature. That was easy enough and she
answered at once without hesitation. The next question
nearly took her breath away. It was some deep
and perplexing thing about the construction of a chord.
Many a music teacher would be puzzled to answer it.
She thought some wicked person had put it in the basket
just to annoy her. Nobody could answer such a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>tremendously hard question. She paused perplexed.
It would not do to fail, and calling up her sturdy will
she compelled herself to think it out. In a moment a
bright gleam passed over her face and she began to
answer the question slowly. Feeling more confident,
she went on explaining the matter, and suddenly went
wrong. She caught herself at once and in a flash corrected
it and gave the right answer.</p>

<p>This was against the rules. No pupil was allowed to
correct himself. He must have it right the first time.
She was greatly frightened, and thought she had made
a failure. She was so earnest and anxious over it, and
moreover she was a girl, the first girl on the violin
ever admitted to the Conservatory, and with a smile
and a word of encouragement the jury forgave her
and accepted her answer. The third question was
quickly answered and the great trial was successfully
finished. This trial of skill, or examination as we
should call it, lasted several days. One day she was
examined in harmony. The singing came another day,
the violin concerto another, and the playing at sight in
a string quartette on still another. The poor girl was
quite worn out and thankful that the summer vacation
came soon after. At our Conservatories and music
schools the pupils take the vacation as a time of rest
and enjoyment. They say it is too hot to work. It is
quite as warm in Paris, and Camilla was as weary as
ever they could be at such a time. Still she rose with
the sun, practiced all the forenoon with her father,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>went to Massart&#8217;s house three times a week, and with
the exception of the hours spent at the Conservatory,
her time passed exactly as if there was no vacation at
all. Work, work, work, all the time. Just enough exercise
to keep her in good health. Only a little play,
now and then. Hours and hours of practice day after
day. Such was her life. A great and splendid reward
was in view. By and by she would win every thing.
When her day of success came she could rest and enjoy
herself. Could she? Did she ever rest? We
shall see.</p>

<span class="caption">THE ROSE OF MONTHOLON.</span></h2>


<p>The last year at the Conservatory was drawing to
an end. It was early summer and Camilla was just
ten years old. The long and difficult course of study
that many a boy was proud to finish when he was nineteen,
was almost over before she had entered her teens.
She was paler and thinner than ever and felt glad the
warm weather had come, for really, her frock was
not thick enough for comfort. That terrible wolf had
again howled in the dark echoing entry way of the house
on the Rue Lamartine. The goodly pile of francs
she had won on the German tour had melted wholly
away. Mother had taken up that dreary embroidery
again. There were four boys to be clothed and fed
now, and Salvatore Urso found it hard work to get
along.</p>

<p>Camilla absorbed in her music hardly knew how serious
the case had become. Many a time she came
home from her lessons to find that the family had been
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>to dinner, and that something nice and warm had been
saved for her. They said they had dined, but in truth
they had only eaten a cheap lunch of fried potatoes
or something a few sous would buy that Camilla
might have a better dinner. She must be maintained
in good health, and no sacrifice on their part was too
great. When they had but little they took the best
for her and concealed from her their own scanty meals.
She was an exceedingly affectionate child and would
have shared her best with her mother had she known
what they silently suffered for her sake.</p>

<p>Her father was constantly with her when she practiced.
Many an hour he stood by her side and held
her left arm to help sustain the weight of her weary
violin. At times he let her sit on a stool though the
good student always stands with the violin. She was a
growing girl and something of the rules must be relaxed.
At the same time her father was a strict master and
never suffered her to slight or neglect her practice.
During the three years at the Conservatory he never
was absent while she practiced though it averaged ten
hours a day during the last year. During it all Camilla
never once refused to go to her lessons and in
company with her aunt or father daily walked to the
Conservatory and to Massart&#8217;s house.</p>

<p>Could they go on much longer? Their case was
getting positively desperate. They had nearly struggled
through the three years. It was almost over and
Camilla was well nigh ready to try her fortune in the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>world. She must play before some of the wealthy amateur
musicians and show her talents. No money
would come of it but it might serve as an introduction
to public life and bring her into notice so that
when she did leave the Conservatory she would not be
wholly unknown.</p>

<p>One day there came an invitation to spend the evening
at some private house and she prepared to go. She
had passably good clothing and was, as far as appearance
was concerned, ready to go. Then came a dreadful
discovery. The wolf was at the door. He had
come up the stairs and was scratching and snarling at
the threshold. What were they to do? There was
not a thing to eat in the house. The very last franc
had been spent. There was nothing left but that pearl
cross the Countess had given her at Manheim. They
might sell it. No they could not and would not. They
would go supperless to bed first. But Camilla, poor
child, was going out. Perhaps she would have a supper
at the friend&#8217;s house where she was to play. And
perhaps not. Besides, she had eaten nothing since
morning. She might faint before the supper hour
came. She could not give it up and go to bed as her
brothers had done. In their perplexity and trouble
Aunt Caroline came with the joyful news that she had
found a sou in an old coat pocket. Only a sou&mdash;a copper
cent. Camilla dressed hastily, and with her father
set out for the private concert where she was to play.
As they walked through the streets they stopped
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>at one of the little cooking stands that are so common
in Paris. With the one cent they bought a paper bag
holding perhaps a pint of fried potatoes. M. Urso
carried the violin and Camilla took the bag and ate
her supper as she passed along. Franklin&#8217;s breakfast
of rolls in the streets of Philadelphia was a royal feast
beside Camilla&#8217;s supper. Using her handkerchief for
a napkin she finished the meal and throwing the paper
bag away entered the grand mansion as the honored
little guest and artist. As for her father he had no
supper at all.</p>

<p>It is always darkest just before dawn. They
struggled through a few more days of bitter poverty
and then came a sudden burst of wealth and good fortune
that fairly took their breath away. It seemed as
if a shower of gold actually rained down upon them
and a new and most remarkable experience came in
the history of the Urso family.</p>

<p>The last term at the Conservatory was nearly finished.
She must give her whole energies to her studies.
The Directors had given out the piece of music
that was to be played by the pupils at the examination
in July and she must go to work upon it. Eight weeks
was little enough time to give to such a piece of music.
It was the 24th Concerto in B Minor for violin by Viotti.
Besides being a work of great difficulty it began
with one short note followed by a longer one. They
must all get that place right, if nothing else. The jury
would not forgive them if they slighted the first note in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>the piece. How they did try over that one passage.
The two notes echoed from every room in the Conservatory
all day long. The boys tried it over at every
spare moment and it did seem to Camilla as if those
were the only notes in the piece. For herself she
practiced it carefully and very slowly, feeling sure it
was better to trust to her own coolness and steadiness
at the trial than to go over it so many times as to become
too confident.</p>

<p>About a year before this a man, who said he came
from America, had appeared at the Conservatory to see
Massart in relation to some music lessons he wished
given to his sons. For convenience we will call this
man the American. He is now dead and as his share
in this story is not the most happy this title may
take the place of his real name. His two sons played
the violin and the father wished them placed under
Massart&#8217;s instruction. Camilla came in during the interview
and quietly waited till it was over. The two
boys played for the master and Camilla sat near by in
silence. Then Massart asked her to play. She did so
and the American was so much pleased that he asked
her name and residence. A day or two after that he
called upon Camilla&#8217;s father and proposed to him that
Camilla should visit the United States as soon as her
lessons were finished at the Conservatory. He thought
she would attract great attention there and offered to
take her to America on a concert tour. This was all
very fine but Camilla could not go now and so the matter
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>was dropped. When the term was over there would
be time enough to talk about it. So the American
went away and the Ursos thought no more about it.</p>

<p>Suddenly in the Summer of the last year and just
before the term was finished he reappeared and repeated
his offer to take Camilla to America. She was
to go with him for three years and was to play at concerts
in all the principal cities of the country.</p>

<p>In consideration of which he would pay M. Urso the
sum of thirty thousand francs the first year, sixty
thousand francs the second year and one hundred thousand
francs the third year. Traveling and hotel expenses
for three people were to be paid and altogether
it was a flattering offer.</p>

<p>Thirty thousand francs in one year! It was too
wonderful! They had never dreamed of so much
money! Sixty thousand francs! A hundred thousand
francs! Such sums were too vast to be taken in at one
sitting. They must consider the matter. After much
discussion it was at last arranged that when her lessons
at the Conservatory were finished Camilla and her father
should start for America.</p>

<p>During the last Spring in Paris they changed their
residence and moved into more cheerful and comfortable
rooms on the Rue Montholon, a street that makes a
continuation of the Rue Lamartine. Here they had
front rooms in the attic and in the sixth story. There
was a broad balcony at the foot of the steep mansard
roof and here Camilla&#8217;s mother arranged a pretty row
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>of plants in pots so that the iron railing in front was
half hid by flowers. Poor as they were they always
managed to have it as bright and pretty about them as
possible. With all their poverty they always contrived
to look neat and pleasant. M. Urso arranged a temporary
shed on the balcony for a kitchen and here in the
bright sunshine high up in the air above the noisy street
Camilla used to watch the birds and the clouds and
peep through the geranium leaves down into the street
so far below. This change of scene was a great advantage
to her. It brightened her spirits and gave her
thin cheeks a bit of color. As she went through the
streets with her violin, and gay in a new chip hat and
blue ribbon the people turned to look at the demure
eyes and the half smiling mouth and said: &#8220;She is
the Rose of Montholon.&#8221;</p>

<p>The Rose could not be suffered to bloom alone in
the alley-ways and lanes of the old city and invitations
to play at the houses of some the grand families came
in. One of these was to the residence of Madam Armengo
and another was the residence of Napoleon then
known as the Prince President. At Madam Armengo&#8217;s
Camilla attracted great attention and won many
friends. Her playing was a surprise to all and the
company could hardly find words to express their pleasure
and admiration.</p>

<p>Then came an invitation from the Prince President
to take part at a grand concert at the Palace de Elys&eacute;e
before the Prince and the great dignitaries of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>court. There were Generals and Marshals, Princesses
and grand Court ladies, artists and gentlemen with
decorations and many other notables. A place on the
programme was assigned to the little Rose of Montholon
and in her usual simple and natural manner she played
her best before the honorable company. They paid her
the best of attention and she quickly captured all their
hearts by her childish manners and wonderful playing.
They had never heard any such playing from one so
young and they crowded around her to thank her and
congratulate her upon her skill.</p>

<p>The Prince Napoleon came and spoke to her, praised
her music and asked what she intended to do next.
Go to America. Ah! No. That was not right. Such
talent as hers must not leave France. M. Urso replied
that the contract had already been signed with the
American and they must go with him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Puisqu &#8217;il en est ainsi, d&eacute;p&eacute;chez vous &agrave; aller gagner
de l&#8217;argent, et revenez vite en France. A votre retour
ne manquez pas de venir me voir.&#8221;</p>

<p>These were the very words of the Prince in reply.
They thanked him heartily and then the party broke
up and they went back to their home on the Rue Montholon.</p>

<p>Then came the final examination at the Conservatory.
It did not differ materially from the one described
before except that it was much more difficult.
The questions in harmony were more searching. The
piece of music to be sung at first sight was more
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>perplexing than ever before and the new quartette for
strings in which she was to take the first violin far exceeded
the others in technical difficulties. Each day of
the trial was a triumph for her. She received the first
prize and never were a family more pleased with the
success of a child. It was a great day for the Ursos
and it seemed as if all their labor and sacrifice was to
be splendidly rewarded. Camilla had never faultered
through it all, and now that it was over the three years
of study seemed as nothing. It had been a hard struggle
but she did not care. It was happily over and
soon she would go to America and gratify her father
by winning a great store of money. Then she would
return to Paris and to dear old Massart. In spite of
his severe discipline he was a good man at heart and she
loved him dearly. She owed everything to him and
she could never half pay him for his generosity in helping
her in her days of poverty. He was very unwilling
to part with his favorite pupil and wanted her to
stay in Paris and continue her lessons. It would cost
her nothing. He would be only too glad to teach her.
It could not be. She must fulfill her contract with the
American.</p>

<p>America. Where was it? So far, so far away.
Would she ever come back from such a distant country?
It seemed in those days a very serious undertaking
and their friends could hardly believe them when
they said they were going to New York.</p>

<p>The Director Auber was also very sorry to part with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>her and kindly wrote a letter of introduction for her.
The following is a copy:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="letterhead"><span class="smcap">Paris</span>, August 12th, 1852.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mademoiselle Camilla Urso is a young pupil of
the National Conservatory of Music. Although still
at a very tender age, she has obtained brilliant success
at several concerts in Paris, and above all at the Conservatory,
where the jury have decreed to her by election
the first prize at the competition for the prizes of
the year.</p>

<p>&#8220;Learning that she is soon to depart for the United
States, I am delighted to state the happy qualities
which ought to ensure a noble artistic career.</p>

<p>&#8220;The Americans have already nobly proved that
they are not only just appreciators of the fine arts, especially
of music, but that they know as well how to recompense
with generosity the merits of the celebrated
artists who are heard in the hospitable towns of their
rich and beautiful country.&#8221;</p>

<p class="signature">AUBER.</p>

<p class="noindent">Member of the Institute and Director of the Conservatory.&#8221;</p></div>

<p>Finally everything was arranged. Aunt Caroline
was to go with Camilla while her mother was to remain
in Paris with the boys. The three years would soon
be over and then they would all be reunited and could
live happily together once more.</p>

<p>The American was liberal in everything. He supplied
them with money for their outfit, and it really
seemed as if their days of trial and poverty were at an
end. There was nothing to do, but to accept and enjoy
the great reward that had crowned their exertions.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>The new dresses, the parting with dear old Massart
and the anticipation of the voyage absorbed Camilla&#8217;s
thoughts, and the sailing day arrived almost too
soon. The trunks were packed and the carriage came
to the door. It was a sad parting for fond mother
and affectionate little girl. She cried bitterly and
would hardly consent to leave her mother&#8217;s arms. As
the carriage drove away she looked back up at the
lofty balcony where the geraniums put their red eyes
through the railing and watched her mother&#8217;s handkerchief
fluttering so high in the air till a turn in the
crooked street shut her dear home from view. Two
weeks later, on the 15th of September, a little girl,
her father and aunt and a violin landed from the
Steamship Humboldt in New York and a new life began
for Camilla.</p>

<p>It was like a dream. They couldn&#8217;t believe it, nor
understand it. It seemed as if they lived in a palace.
They had three parlors furnished in the most costly
and elegant style. There were yellow satin chairs in
one room and blue in the next. Obsequious servants
waited upon their every want. Camilla&#8217;s room looked
out on Broadway and the view from the window afforded
her unending amusement She hardly dared to
sit in the satin chairs. They were almost too fine for
use. Such splendor and luxury was really oppressive.
And the people! What a strange language they spoke.
She was sure she could never understand it. She listened
and tried and only succeeded in pronouncing the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>name of the hotel which she gave as the &#8220;Ir-ving
House.&#8221;</p>

<p>The first few days they gave themselves up to sight
seeing. The American called frequently and said that
the first concert would come off very soon. He had
advertised it extensively and the whole troupe must
prepare for the great event. In the meantime they
must be prepared to receive company, for the authorities
would soon call upon them. This they thought
would be quite proper and they felt sure they would receive
the dignitaries of the city with becoming respect.</p>

<p>In order to give a proper variety to Camilla&#8217;s concerts
other talent had been engaged. Oscar Comettant
and his wife had been invited by the American to join
the troupe. He was to assist as accompanist and his
wife was to sing. There was also a M. Fetlinger a buffo
singer. This enabled them to present with Camilla&#8217;s
assistance the best of programmes.</p>

<p>While they were thus waiting at the Irving House
for their first concert, the whole party M. and Madam
Comettant, M. Urso, Camilla, and Aunt Caroline all
went out to walk one bright sunny morning. As they
strolled through the streets they suddenly came to a
dead wall where in gorgeous letters six feet high was
printed the startling announcement:&mdash;</p>

<p class="sixfeethigh">&#8220;CAMILLA URSO HAS ARRIVED.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>They all stopped and gazed with feelings of wonder
and awe, upon this remarkable sentence.</p>

<p>Oscar Comettant was the only one who could translate
it and when he had done so they all repeated it
over to themselves. As for Camilla she committed it
to memory as the first sentence she had ever spoken in
English. They returned to the Irving House remarking
to themselves that America was truly a wonderful
country. The intelligent natives appreciated music.
They welcomed artists in a truly royal manner, and
published their names in letters six feet high. While
they were talking over the matter the American suddenly
came in. He seemed greatly excited over something.
Was the Mayor coming? Were the authorities
coming to visit them? Should they dress for company?</p>

<p>Ah! No! Something had happened. He was very
sorry&mdash;but&mdash;his partner&mdash;who supplied the money, etc.
had&mdash;failed?</p>

<p>Failed! What did he mean! Failed?</p>

<p>No money?</p>

<p>No, not a dollar left!</p>

<p>They couldn&#8217;t believe it. Were they to give no
concert? Was not Camilla going to play? Was the
grand scheme a failure?</p>

<p>Yes. It was all over. Everything had failed.</p>

<p>The whole party was utterly stupified and hadn&#8217;t
a word to say. What should they do? Where were
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>they to go? The disaster was too great for comprehension.
They hardly knew what to say much less
what to do. The American could do nothing. He
had not a dollar in the world.</p>




<h2><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span><a name="CHAPTER_I_VII" id="CHAPTER_I_VII"></a>CHAPTER VII.<br />

<span class="caption">&#8220;CAMILLA URSO HAS ARRIVED.&#8221;</span></h2>


<p>What were they to do next? They could not speak
a word of English and had not a dollar. They would
gladly return to France could they manage the tickets.
It was impossible. Something must be done. A concert
or two must be given. Camilla would surely succeed
if she had a hearing. The American must not
desert them utterly. He might, at least, act as their
business agent and assist them in giving a few concerts.</p>

<p>They could repeat the plan that they had tried with
such success in Germany. Camilla might play before
some of the wealthy families and then give a concert.
It did not meet their expectations. The customs
of the country were different, and though she
visited Commodore Stevens, then living at Hoboken, and
played for him, nothing came of it. He was greatly
pleased with the child and on taking her to a jeweler&#8217;s
bid her select such a ring as she fancied. A ring with
a variety of stones, a sentiment ring, took her girlish
eyes and she chose it in preference to a more costly
one.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>And that was all that came of it. Her visit did not
lead to a concert and their fortunes seemed as desperate
as ever. M. Urso went everywhere among his
countrymen and told his story and endeavored to find
a chance for Camilla to play. He could not give a
concert on his own responsibility. Some artist must
be found to bring Camilla out before the American
public.</p>

<p>Fortunately, Madam Alboni was in New York about
this time and through her kindness an opportunity was
found for Camilla. Three concerts were arranged in
which Camilla might make her bow before the American
people. Child violinists were not unknown in
New York. Paul Julian had played in the city and
had attracted much attention. The announcement
that a new child-artist&mdash;a girl and a violinist would appear
only roused curiosity and people were eager to see
how she compared with the boy Julian. They called
her Camilla&mdash;Camilla Urso. Who was she? Where
did she come from? No one seemed to know. Madam
Alboni was to bring her out. The child must
have some talent to be patronized by such an artist as
Madam Alboni.</p>

<p>Only ten years of age. Certainly a marvelous child.
And a girl. It must be a sight worth seeing. They
would all go to the concert. In this shallow style did
the people of New York talk. They looked upon
her as some kind of natural wonder, or curiosity. That
she might have an artist&#8217;s soul, that her playing might
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>be something more than mere display did not seem to
enter their comprehension.</p>

<p>In due time the concert came off and a slender, blue
eyed girl hardly four feet high appeared and played a
fantasia or themes from Somnambula. They had expected
she would play fairly well, they looked for tolerable
skill. What they did see and hear so far exceeded
their expectations that they could not find words to express
their admiration.</p>

<p>The steady position, the vigor and grace of her bowing,
the strong, firm tone, and more than all the wonderful
delicacy and lightness of her touch. The splendid
technical ability, and her simple manners, the demure
and serious eyes and the slight, girlish figure,
these captured their hearts and won their respect.</p>

<p>The concert was a great success and Camilla in a
single night established her reputation in the United
States. This was her first real step in her artist life.
She here laid the foundation of her reputation, a reputation
that was first American and afterwards European.</p>

<p>The next morning the New York Herald gave her
the first newspaper notice she ever received in this
country.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>&#8220;Little Camilla Urso, the wonderful child violinist,
divided honors with the prima donna. Of the same
age and country as Paul Julian, whose masterly performance
on the violin attracted so much attention
here, this new candidate for public favor promises to be
a powerful competitor with him. Her execution of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>the fantasia or Somnambula was most admirable and
drew down vociferous calls for an encore which were
honored. Several bouquets were thrown to her on the
stage and the greatest enthusiasm was manifested in
respect to the marvelous little artist.&#8221;</p></div>

<p>Then some one suggested that they try Boston.
That city was a musical centre and Camilla would be
sure to meet with a good reception there. Accordingly
under the guidance of the American the entire party
went to Boston. Mr. Jonas Chickering, the piano-forte
manufacturer kindly welcomed her and invited her to
call at his residence on Boylston street, two doors from
the building now occupied by the Art Club. So much
pleased was he with her simple manners and her wonderful
playing that he opened his elegant warerooms
and invited a select company of musical people to hear
her play. This private concert first brought Camilla
before us. She had, as it were, come before us. Hitherto,
it had been a strange story that had been told to us.
We could now see and hear for ourselves.</p>

<p>The Boston Transcript and Dwight&#8217;s Journal of Music,
then our best authorities upon art matters thus
spoke of this occasion:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>&#8220;Her violin playing is not that of a child,&mdash;even a
remarkable child&mdash;but that of an <i>artiste</i> cultivated and
accomplished. Her bowing is extremely graceful and
free, her execution neat and clear, her intonation perfect.&#8221;</p></div>

<p>Dwight&#8217;s Journal of Oct. 9th says:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>&#8220;Little Camilla Urso, the violinist, but eleven years
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>old, announced a concert at the Masonic Temple for
last evening, just too late for notice in this paper. But
we had the pleasure,&mdash;and a choice one it was&mdash;of
hearing her the other evening in a company of some
forty invited guests, in Mr. Chickering&#8217;s saloon. Her
playing is not only truly wonderful, but wonderfully
true;&mdash;true in style, expression, feeling, as it is true in
intonation and all mechanical respects. She played Artot&#8217;s
<i>Souvenirs de Bellini</i>, and never have we listened
to a long fantasia of several themes, worked up in all
manner of variations, with a purer pleasure. It was
masterly; the firm and graceful bowing, the rich, pure,
refined tone, the light and shade, the easy control of
<i>arpeggio</i>, <i>staccato</i>, <i>double stops</i>, etc., were all such as we
could only have expected from the maturest masters
we have heard. We could scarcely credit our own
eyes and ears.</p>

<p>The little maiden is plain, with strong arms and
hands enlarged by practice of her instrument; yet her
appearance is most interesting; a face full of intellectual
and sedate expression, a large forehead wearing the
&#8217;pale cast of thought&#8217; etc. Pity only that such fine
life must be lived out so fast, and always in the blaze
of too much sun for plants so young and tender!&#8221;</p></div>

<p>Then followed two concerts at the Masonic Temple.
Concerning her playing at these concerts we may quote
from Dwight&#8217;s Journal of October 16th.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><span class="smcap">Camilla Urso.</span> &#8220;Two concerts have confirmed
all we have said of this wonderful girl violinist. Two
concerts, attended by an intelligent, nay, an exacting,
audience delighted almost to tears&mdash;and yet not money
enough in the house to pay expenses! Indifference to
flaming advertisements of precocity is well; but it is
<i>not</i> well, not worthy of the taste of Boston thus to neglect
one of the finest manifestations of genius that ever
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>seemed to come to us so straight from heaven. It was
one of the most beautiful, most touching experiences of
our whole musical life, to see and hear that charming
little maiden, so natural and childlike, so full of sentiment
and thought, so selfpossessed and graceful in her
whole bearing and in her every motion, handle her instrument
there like a master, drawing forth tones of
purest and most feeling quality; with an infallible truth
of intonation, unattained by many an orchestra leader;
reproducing perfectly, as if by the hearts own direct
magnetic agency, an entire Concerto of Viotti or De
Beriot, wooing forth the gentler melodies with a fine
caressing delicacy and giving out strong passages in
chords with ever thrilling grandeur.&#8221;</p></div>

<p>The first of these concerts was on the 8th and the
second on the 12th of the month. Neither was successful
and evil days again came upon them. The concert
company broke up and each looked out for himself as
best he could. As for Camilla she returned to New
York with her father and aunt and they settled down
in poor and miserable quarters in a house on Howard
street&mdash;the Rue Lamartine of New York.</p>

<p>Her reception in Boston had not been a pleasant
one. There seemed to be a prejudice against her.
The good people could not quite forgive her for being
a girl. It was well for Paul Julian&mdash;he was a boy.
Camilla&#8217;s appearance disturbed their nice sense of propriety.
This is only the more remarkable when we
come to see that later in her life Boston became her
second home. It was here that she afterwards laid the
foundation for her reputation and here she won her
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>greatest triumphs. Since, she has played in our city
over two hundred times and here her greatest and latest
artistic efforts have been made. Little did she
think as she left the city that she should afterwards enter
it twice under most peculiar circumstances and afterwards
make it the home of her girlhood and sometimes
her residence in womanhood.</p>

<p>Heaven helps those who try to help themselves. It
was useless to cry or sit down in despair. Camilla at
once resumed her practice under her father&#8217;s guidance.
The violin was taken out again and the wretched alley-ways
about Howard street reechoed with the strains of
the marvelous instrument. By the hour the music
floated out the dismal chamber window where the
wonder-child toiled over the seemingly hopeless task.
The thin, pale face bent over the music book all the day
long. Practice, practice, practice. Life seemed made
for that.</p>

<p>What was the good of it all? It had only brought
them poverty and sorrow. Not for a moment did she
pause. The art was reward enough without the money.
She would wait.</p>

<p>It happened just at this time that Paul Julian, not in
the most happy financial circumstances came to New
York and for a week lived in the same humble boarding
house with the Ursos. Camilla&#8217;s room was up stairs
and Paul&#8217;s just under it. Both practiced incessantly,
and Camilla&#8217;s father while attending to her lessons
would often say:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>&#8220;Hear that boy! He loves to practice.&#8221;</p>

<p>Paul&#8217;s father in the room below would bid the boy
stop and listen to the girl artist overhead and say:&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;Hear that girl! See how she loves to practice.&#8221;</p>

<p>When the lesson hour was over the two children
met on the stairs or on the sidewalk for their brief play
hour and would exchange notes concerning their two
fathers.</p>

<p>&#8220;Was your father cross to-day?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes. Cross as a bear!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;So was mine.&#8221;</p>

<p>Camilla did not remain in obscurity and poverty
long. Archbishop Hughes heard of her and arranged
a charity concert in which she was invited to appear.
The concert was for the benefit of the Catholic Orphan
Asylum and as Camilla had contributed largely to its
success a share of the proceeds were given to her father.
This fortunately saved them from immediate
want and in a few days after a still greater piece of
luck came to them. A letter came from Philadelphia
inviting Camilla to play at a concert given by the
Philharmonic society of that city. She at once went
to Philadelphia in company with her father and
aunt and there received one hundred and fifty dollars
for a single performance on her violin. This was the
largest sum she had ever received at one time and it
seemed as if their day of small things was nearly over.</p>

<p>While they were in Philadelphia an agent of the
Germania Musical Society of Boston visited them and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>invited Camilla to join the Society in a series of concerts
that they proposed to give in the New England
cities. A handsome salary was offered and they all
three started once more for Boston.</p>

<p>They took rooms at the United States Hotel and
prepared for a long stay. Camilla&#8217;s return and reappearance
in our streets was not happy. They arrived
on Saturday and the next day having nothing in particular
to do Camilla took aunt Caroline&#8217;s hand and
they went out for a little walk. The streets, so
strangely quiet in their foreign eyes, seemed dull and
they walked on thinking they might come to some garden
or pleasure ground where the people would be listening
to a band, drinking coffee and making merry in a
proper manner.</p>

<p>They could not find the place. The stores were all
closed and it seemed very stupid and gloomy. They
would return to their hotel. It was down this street
No. It was that way. Which way was it? The
streets were so very crooked that really they were
quite lost.</p>

<p>They stopped a gentleman and said as best they
could&mdash;&#8220;Unated Statis Hotel?&#8221; He did not seem to
understand and passed on. Then they tried a lady
and repeated the words &#8220;Unated Statis Hotel?&#8221; The
lady talked about something but they could not understand
a single word. Again and again they stopped
people on the walk and repeated the strange words.
Every one shook his head or talked rapidly about
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>things they could not understand and not one could
show the way to the &#8220;Unated Statis Hotel.&#8221;</p>

<p>Poor Camilla began to cry with the cold and they
were having a sorry time of it. They met an Irish
servant girl going home from church. They repeated
the words to her and the quick witted girl soon led
them back a few steps and showed them the great brick
block with its gilded sign &#8220;United States Hotel.&#8221;</p>

<p>Now it was that we became familiar with Camilla&#8217;s
face in our streets. Her black felt hat and long dark
green plume that was at once so singular and so very
becoming, her big blue eyes with the sly twinkle in
them, the smiling mouth and sweet tempered expression
of her face won unusual attention and admiration.
Children in the streets said &#8220;there goes Camilla Urso,&#8221;
and ran after her to see the pretty French girl who
had come to live among us. Traditions of her girlhood
days are still treasured up in many Boston families and
pleasant stories are told of this part of her life. She
here grew in mind and stature and she was no longer
little Camilla but Mademoiselle Camilla Urso.</p>

<p>The first concert with the Germanias was given on
the evening of December 11th, and from that time
there was a brief space of financial happiness for our
young Mademoiselle. For several months she had
more leisure than she had ever known in her short life.
Their headquarters were in Boston and the tours were
short and easy.</p>

<p>There seemed to be no immediate prospect of returning
to France and something must be done about
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>Mademoiselle&#8217;s English education. The family made
their home at the United States Hotel and during the
intervals between the short concert trips a private tutor
came to their rooms to instruct her young ladyship
in the language of the country. Nothing had been
done even in French and she found herself woefully ignorant
for a ten year old girl. It made very little difference
for she took up the matter with enthusiasm and
learned to read in an incredibly short time. Within
three months she could express herself with tolerable
ease in English and learned to read almost anything
that was put before her either in French or English.
How it happened she could hardly explain. It must
have been the intuitive grasping of a mind prematurely
active and retentive. She could read music as
easily as a Boston girl of her age could read the daily
papers, and it did not seem to her in any sense difficult
to understand the much more simple alphabet of
spoken language. She had only one objection to her
tutor. He helped her over the hard words and all
that and was not cross but as she confided to her aunt,
&#8220;he was very disagreeable&mdash;she didn&#8217;t like him for he
chewed&mdash;and it wasn&#8217;t pleasant.&#8221;</p>

<p>At the same time such a demure puss, with such
proper notions about manners was not above joining
some of the other girls in grand romps in the corridors
of the hotel, nor afraid to join them in the glorious mischief
of changing all the boots put out at the doors of
the rooms and then listen at the top of the stairs at the
fine uproar caused by their pranks.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>It was during this residence in Boston that Camilla
was confirmed at Church and she passed the allotted
weeks of preparation at the Convent of Notre Dame
at Roxbury. Her father thought it a sad loss of time
on account of her violin practice, but for Camilla it
was a period of unalloyed happiness. She was the pet
of the school, and her simple, childlike nature bloomed
out freely in the quiet atmosphere of the place. Here
for the first time she learned to use her needle. Pen,
needles, pen-knife and scissors had been carefully kept
out of her hands for fear of possible injury to her fingers
and yet she learned to sew quite well in a very
few lessons. It was merely a mechanical operation
and it came to her in a flash. She astonished the good
sisters with her feats of embroidery and fine sewing
and they could not understand how such an one could
learn so quickly. The manual skill of playing and the
quick eye in reading music had probably much to do
with it. The weeks at the convent were like a charming
oasis in the dry and dusty plain of her public life
and she came out of the school blooming with health
and happiness.</p>

<p>On the 4th of April, 1853, the Germanias started
out on an extended tour through the Western States
and with them went Mademoiselle Camilla, her father
and aunt. It was upon this trip that Camilla Urso&#8217;s
face became familiar to the people of this country.
She had visited nearly every important city and town
in New England and now she played in every large
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>city through the Northern and Western States. She
went as far west as St. Louis and as far south as the
Ohio. It was a stirring, eventful life. Traveling constantly,
playing four or five times a week, meeting new
friends every day, practicing steadily and growing in
mind and stature she seemed to have found the desire
of her young heart. Finally the trip ended at Rochester,
New York, on the 11th of June, and the company
separated. The Germanias went to Newport for their
summer campaign and the Ursos returned to New
York.</p>

<p>Madam Henrietta Sontag was at this time traveling
in this country. She had given a series of very successful
operatic performances in Boston and New York
during the Winter and Spring, and proposed to make a
concert tour through the West and South during the
Fall and Winter. M. Urso while in New York received
a letter from her agent inviting Camilla to join the
troupe. Accordingly she set out with her father and
met Madam Sontag&#8217;s party at Cincinnati. Aunt Caroline
traveled with them as far as Louisville, Ky. Madam
Sontag, who was greatly pleased with Camilla here
offered to have a motherly eye over her and accordingly
her aunt returned to New York and only M.
Urso remained to be guide and helper to our young
Mademoiselle.</p>

<p>For Camilla this trip was a season of great happiness.
She was earning money rapidly, her mother in
far away Paris could share in the golden store and her
father was pleased and satisfied.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>Madam Sontag became a second mother to Camilla
and treated her with the utmost kindness. Every day
Camilla must come to her room to practice and receive
instructions in singing. Camilla&#8217;s instrument was the
violin. She could sing with more than ordinary skill
and in perfecting her phrasing and in improving her
style in vocal music Madam Sontag insensibly improved
her violin music. All of Camilla&#8217;s music was
examined by the great singer and in those stray hours
picked up between the demand of concerts and travel
much of art and happiness was enjoyed.</p>

<p>Camilla was the favorite of the entire company.
There was Pozzolini, the tenor, fat Badially, the bass,
jolly Rocco the buffo singer and Alfred Jael the rising
young pianist, merriest of them all. With each Camilla
was a pet. Every one seemed ready to please the
young girl and in their society life passed happily.
Freed from anxiety and the excessive and wearisome
practice her nature expanded and she began to show
that sweet and amiable character that so brightens her
maturer years.</p>

<p>Giving concerts at every city the party took their
triumphant way down the Ohio and Mississippi to New
Orleans. The brilliant concerts, the strange people,
the mighty river, the life on the palatial steamboats, the
perpetual change of scene awoke Camilla&#8217;s fancy and
imagination and developed her character rapidly.
The publicity, the glare and the excitement only
brought out her intellectual and artistic power. Most
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>young people would have been upset and spoiled by
vanity. Her young days in the orchestra at Nantes had
accustomed her to public life, and the poverty and trial
she had gone through served as good ballast to keep
her steady when riding on the topmost wave of success.</p>

<p>The tour ended at New Orleans with even greater
triumphs. Camilla appeared eighteen times in company
with Madam Sontag and each concert was a perfect
success in every sense.</p>

<p>Then in a moment the bright dream came to an end.
Madam Sontag and her opera company set out for
Mexico, leaving Camilla and her father in New Orleans.
She would return soon and in the mean time
Camilla could wait and by study and practice prepare
for a new tour through the Northern States in the
Spring.</p>

<p>In a few weeks came the dreadful news that the good
and amiable woman, and the great <i>artist</i> was dead.
She had died after a brief illness in the city of Mexico
and all of Camilla&#8217;s hopes were destroyed. Again she
was without employment and without money. Her
father was not distinguished for sound financial ability.
He was too generous and liberal, and in spite of the
large sums of gold that had been paid to him on Camilla&#8217;s
account he found himself in actual distress at
the breaking up of the Sontag combination. With
reasonable prudence they could have saved enough to
enable them to retreat to the more prosperous field in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>the Northern States. As it was Camilla was obliged
to begin again, and slowly, and painfully win her way
back alone to the North and to happier days. An
agent was found to take her through the Southern
cities and thence by the way of the seaboard to New
York. It was not a happy trip. There was no longer a
great singer to attract attention, there was no obedient
and skillful business man traveling ahead to prepare
the way and secure hotel comforts and financial success.</p>

<p>Camilla&#8217;s violin was the only attraction, and to fill
out the programme they were obliged to call in the aid
of such local talent as they could find in the various
cities they visited. Mobile, Savannah, Charleston, and
other places were visited and after a slow and disagreeable
journey they arrived in Baltimore in the Spring of
1855 almost without a cent.</p>

<p>Here came a singular episode in Camilla&#8217;s life that
will illustrate the perfection of her schooling at the
Conservatory of music at Paris. A gentleman and a
public singer heard of Camilla&#8217;s difficulties and arranged
a concert for her benefit. At this concert Camilla
for the first and only time laid aside her violin
and appeared as a singer. No one had thought of her
in this character and her duet from the opera of L&#8217;elisir
d&#8217;Amore, by Donizetti, was a great surprise. She exhibited
a fine, clear voice almost as well trained as her
fingers. The performance only showed how thorough
had been her instruction in solfeggio at the Conservatory.
Every true artist is a singer. No matter what
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>his or her instrument may be, no matter how skillful their
fingers may be with bow or keys, singing must form a
part of their education. This is the theory of Camilla&#8217;s
study in music. The practice of solfeggio gives clearness
and accuracy to the ear, and teaches the eye to
read with certainty and speed. Much of her understanding
of music has come from such practice and it
should form a part of every musician&#8217;s education.</p>

<p>Finally father and daughter reached New York after
an absence of nearly nine months, and almost as
poor as when they started. The Summer season was at
hand and there was very little opportunity for concerts.
In company with her father she then went to Canada
and there traveled from place to place giving occasional
concerts and everywhere winning many friends. Invitations
to visit the homes of private families came to
them freely and for Camilla the trip was a very happy
one. So happy indeed that she was unwilling to leave
her new friends even when the news of her mother&#8217;s
arrival in New York was received. M. Urso went on
to receive his wife, but Camilla persisted in staying
where she was. She was the admired and sought after
young girl. Every one seemed ready to offer her
every pleasure and attention and she was far from willing
to return to the life of concert giving and practice.</p>

<p>Concerning the music that Mademoiselle Urso played
at this time, we may mention a few of the pieces usually
given at her concerts. They give us not only an
idea of her musical ability, but serve to illustrate the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>character of the concert pieces in vogue at that time.
No musical life would be complete, even if it is that of
a &#8220;wonder-child&#8221; without some information concerning
the actual work performed. Mademoiselle Urso
was not in any sense limited in her range of pieces.
She did not have a mere stock set that she always
played. She could and did play everything that had
been printed for the violin. In her girlhood&#8217;s concerts
she chose those most popular without much regard to
their actual position in the art. She had not then
reached her true artist-life and was not, as now, in a
position to lead the public taste into the higher fields of
classic music. She played then such pieces as the <i>Violin
Concerto</i>, by <i>Viotti</i>, <i>Alard&#8217;s Souvenir</i> the <i>Daughter
of the Regiment</i>, <i>Souvenir de Gretry</i>, <i>Souvenir de Mozart</i>,
by <i>Leonard</i>, and the <i>Tremolo</i>, by <i>De Beriot</i>. She
also gave at times the <i>Witches&#8217; Dance</i>, by <i>Paganini</i>
and <i>La Melancholie</i>, by <i>Prune</i>.</p>

<p>After some delay Camilla joined her father and
mother at New York, and the family were once more
reunited. It was at this time that they had the misfortune
to have their rooms entered, and all the presents,
including the pearl cross that Camilla had received on
that almost forgotten German tour, were stolen.</p>

<p>The family were not united long. In the Fall Mrs. Macready,
the reader, invited Camilla to join her troupe
on a tour through the West. As mother and daughter
had been separated for a long time Madam Urso
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>traveled with Camilla a portion of this journey. Unfortunately
Madam Urso was taken sick at Cincinnati
and for a while Camilla traveled alone with Mrs. Macready.
This tour was quite a successful one for Camilla
and it finally ended in Nashville, Tenn., where
the party separated.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_II_I" id="CHAPTER_II_I"></a>CHAPTER I.<br />

<span class="caption">INTO EACH LIFE SOME RAIN MUST FALL.</span></h2>


<p>At the close of her tour with Mrs. Macready in 1855
Mademoiselle Urso left the concert stage, gave up playing
in public and retired to private life in Nashville,
Tenn., only appearing at occasional charity concerts.
Seven years later, in the Autumn of 1862, she returned
to New York prepared to resume her artist-life. The
musical world remembered with respect and admiration
the Camilla Urso of her brilliant girlhood. The wonderful
child-life had ended. The new artist-life now
begins. Once more the swift fingers might fly over
the mystic strings. Again the bow arm wield its magic
wand.</p>

<p>Could they? Would the art come back after seven
years of almost total neglect? Would the woman fulfill
the promise of the child? She could not tell. It
seemed a life-time since she had played in public. It
was a doubtful experiment. She would not hesitate
nor be afraid. She would try again.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>&#8220;Father, I have come home.&#8221;</p>

<p>Father, mother, daughter and dear aunt once more
reunited. It was an humble home in the midst of the
great city. It was home and that was enough.</p>

<p>&#8220;What now, my daughter?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Music, father. My violin. Give it me once more.&#8221;</p>

<p>Once more the violin is placed on the young shoulder
and the bow is laid with caressing touch upon the beloved
strings. Ten and often fifteen hours a day incessant
practice. No rigid Massart to watch every
note. No father to sit by to guide and help. Alone
with her violin. She would have no master now. She
would be her own master. Her genius should be her
guide.</p>

<p>Again the long, slow notes. Again the patient finger
exercises. From the almost forgotten years she recalled
the lessons of the Conservatory and the instructions
of dear old Felix Simon, at sunny Nantes. He
was at hand and lived in New York. He might help
her. No, she did not wish it. She refused even her
father&#8217;s aid. She knew herself now. Times had
changed since those old days in Nantes. Music had
changed. Violin playing had changed. She could not
tell exactly how or why, but she felt sure it must be so.
If she was to succeed she must come up with the level
of the age. The standard of musical taste had changed
during the seven years of blank in her artist life. The
playing of the &#8220;wonder-child&#8221; would no longer please
the public, much less herself. If her music was then
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>remarkable for a child it must now be equally remarkable
for a woman. No half way halting, no inferior
work. She had no longer the excuse of being a child.
She must win her own place alone and unaided.</p>

<p>Thus thinking, hoping and toiling incessantly she
spent the weeks, and then the toil become a pleasure
and the hope fruition. To her surprise and joy it all
came back. And with it came something else. A
new discovery in her art. Her violin had a new voice.
A wonderful something was in its every tone. What
was it? The brilliant sparkle and fire of her girlhood-music
was all there. Everything had returned and
with it had come a lovely spirit born of love and sorrow.
She love her violin. She had known grief.
Both lived in her music.</p>

<p>Three months of hard study and then she felt ready
to once more try her fortune. The fame of her return
had quickly spread, and early in 1863 a letter arrived
from Carl Zerrahn the conductor of the Philharmonic
Society in Boston, inviting her to play before the Society
in our city. She accepted the invitation and once
more stood before us, violin in hand, and surrounded by
hosts of kind and true friends ready to welcome her
back again.</p>

<p>Here begins the new artist-life in our own city and at
her childhood&#8217;s second home where she had won such
honors as a girl. Her first appearance was at the Music
Hall on the 14th of February, and on this occasion
she played the <i>Fantasie Caprice</i> by <i>Vieuxtemps</i> and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>the <i>Andante et Rondo Russe</i> by <i>De Beriot</i>.</p>

<p>On the 21st she played again and gave the <i>Souvenir
de Mozart</i> by <i>Alard</i> and the <i>Cappicco</i> on themes from
<i>Fille du Regiment</i>.</p>

<p>On the 2d of March she played a <i>Fantasie sur Lucrezia
Borgia</i> by <i>Stanton</i>, the <i>Souvenir des Pyrenees</i> by
<i>Alard</i>, a <i>Duet</i> from <i>William Tell</i>, for violin and piano
and repeated the <i>Vieuxtemps Fantasie caprice</i>.</p>

<p>Immediately after this she was called to New York
to play at the Philharmonic concerts in that city. At
one of these concerts the pianist Gottschalk, who happened
to be present, became so excited over her playing
that he jumped upon the seat and proposed cheers
for Madam Urso, and at the close of the performance
introduced himself to her in the ante-room and fairly
overwhelmed her with congratulations and praise. It
was a great surprise and pleasure to her, as the opinion
of such a musician was of real value. She now grew
more confident. The promise of her girlhood might
yet be fulfilled. She would take new courage and go
on with the work. She would practice and study every
available moment. In time she would become indeed
a great artist. She would not now stop to dream of
future success. She must work and work hard.</p>

<p>Success and triumph were near at hand and almost
before she was ready to receive them, engagements to
play flowed in upon her from every direction. The
days of poverty and trial were over. A steadily increasing
financial success followed her efforts and,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>taught by the sorrowful experience of her childhood,
she managed her affairs with wisdom and laid the
foundation of her present independence. In May she
gave a concert in Boston on her own behalf at Chickering
hall and played <i>Grand duo brilliant</i> for piano
and violin, <i>La Mucette de Portici</i> by <i>Wolff</i> and <i>De
Beriot</i>, <i>Reverie</i> by <i>Vieuxtemps</i>, <i>Elegie</i> by <i>Ernst</i>, and the
<i>William Tell Duo</i> by <i>De Beriot</i>.</p>

<p>These were the most popular pieces of the day.
They all belong to the transcription or fantasie style.
Enormously difficult and well calculated to please the
fancy and amuse the ear, they give a hint of Madam
Urso&#8217;s ability at that time and show just about how
far American culture had risen. It is interesting to
notice them as we shall see how rapid and how great
have been the changes in violin music in the last ten
years that are included in this part of the story of a
musical life.</p>

<p>In June she made a short tour through the Provinces
and then returned to New York and spent the Summer
quietly among friends and in practice upon her violin.</p>

<p>Nothing satisfied her in music. The true artist never
is satisfied, but is ever urged onward by a noble discontent.
The concert pieces demanded by the public,
were not to her taste. She could do better work.
She knew and played finer works than these. The
people would not listen to them. She would wait.
In time they would grow up to something better. In
all this she was ever urged on higher and higher, trying
new feats of technical skill, drawing forth even finer
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>tones and continually advancing towards the higher
standard of excellence she had set for herself. In all
this she met with obstacles and difficulties. She could
not have instruction from others. There were none in
the country who could teach her anything and her concerts
broke in upon her time seriously. She was studying
for public appearance and appearing in public at
the same time.</p>

<p>On the opening of the musical season in the fall of
1863 Madam Urso was engaged by Mr. P. S. Gilmore
to play at his concerts in Boston. The summer of apparent
idleness had been well spent. Her study and
practice bore splendid fruit and her genius bloomed out
into new and wonderful music that seemed to exhale a
perfume as ethereal and delicate as it was peculiar and
original. The woman&#8217;s hand and heart lived in the
music. To all the brilliancy and technical skill of a
man she added a feminine lightness of touch, that in
airy lightness, and grace, melting tenderness and sweetness
is past description. Her violin now seemed to
breathe and sigh. The tears would come to the
listener&#8217;s eyes he knew not why. The tears were in
the tones. The sorrow of her life exhaled in chastened
sweetness from the strings. Her heart ran out on her
finger tips and lived in her music.</p>

<p>It is not surprising that at one of these concerts the
musicians of Boston should have united in presenting a
testimonial of respect and admiration and personal regard
to her as an artist and a woman. The letter was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>signed by the musical people of note resident in Boston
and was accompanied by a handsome gold watch.</p>

<p>However interesting the details of these events may
seem it is impossible to dwell upon them all. We must
take the more salient points in Madam Urso&#8217;s artist
life, choosing such events as best illustrate her character
and best explain the secret of her success that we
may learn the true artistic lesson of her life and works.
After traveling under Mr. Gilmore&#8217;s direction through
all the principal towns of New England, Madam Urso
left his company and spent the summer months in
traveling in her private carriage with a small party of
her own, and giving occasional concerts by the way.</p>

<p>She reached New York late in the fall and at once
organized a new company, and visited Canada. This
trip was a remarkably successful one, and extended till
January, 1865. She then appeared at the Philharmonic
concerts at New York and Brooklyn, and on reorganizing
her company visited Northern and Central
New York. She was at Syracuse at the time of the
assassination of Lincoln and moved by the event composed
an elegy for the violin that was afterwards performed
with great success at Rochester.</p>

<p>The early summer of this year was spent among
friends and in retirement and was entirely devoted to
incessant and long continued practice. Practice upon
her violin is the one thing that is never neglected. If
it is not reported on every page it is because it is always
present, never forgotten. This is the one price
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>every great artist must pay for his or her position.
What a commentary on our American haste to reach
results does Madam Urso&#8217;s life-work present? She has
genius. Genius without labor is worse than vain.</p>

<p>In June Madam Urso sailed in the China from Boston
and passing through London returned once more to
France her native land. Returned to live in dear old
Paris but not in the Rue Lamartine. The city of her
childhood sorrows and trials now became the city of her
triumph. Her reputation both as a wonder-child and
an artist had been almost wholly American. Now she
was to take a bolder flight and win a European reputation.
The opinions of our musical people were to be
more than confirmed at Paris.</p>

<p>Her first appearance in Paris was at the invitation of
the Count of Niewerkerke, then Minister of fine arts.
The concert was a private one given at the Louvre before
a select audience of artists, authors, musicians, officers
and members of the government, diplomatic corps,
etc. Every one appeared in uniform or decorated with
medals or other insignia of rank, &#8220;and the young
woman from America&#8221; whom nobody knew, and nobody
ever heard, whose name even, was hardly known
quietly took a seat in a corner as if she was only some
stray person who had wandered into the grand assembly
by some mistake. No little surprise was manifested
when the Count sought her out and offered his arm
to the young stranger to escort her to the seat of honor.
Her violin case. It laid at her feet on the floor. If he
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>would kindly ask a servant to bring it? Servant, indeed!
No, he would be proud to carry it himself.
And he did while the interest and curiosity was roused
to unusual excitement, and every one asked who the
young American could be that she should receive such
attention. A prophet is always without honor in his
own country, and the poor flute player&#8217;s daughter who
had struggled through their own famous Conservatory
as a child was almost unknown as a young woman.
Rumors of an American reputation had invaded Paris,
but who were the Americans that they should venture
to hold opinions concerning Art. What did they know
about music? Nothing, of course. How could such a
wild, barbarous country know anything at all?</p>

<p>The violin was taken out and with a few strokes of
her bow the almost unknown young woman was admitted
to be a peer among them all. Never was an artist
received with greater honors and distinction. One
performance and her reputation was established. They
suddenly found she was, as it were, one of themselves.
France was her native land, Paris her home and so no
honor they could bestow upon her would be too great.
Pasdeloup, the orchestral director, was present and
then and there invited her to play with his famous orchestra.
So it was that the doors of fashionable and
artistic Europe were thrown open at one wave of the
magic bow. Our artist played the great Concerto in E
by Mendelssohn with Pasdeloup&#8217;s magnificent orchestra
at the hall of the Conservatory and won a splendid
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>triumph on the very spot where in the days of her
poverty-tinted childhood she first drew her bow before
her severe old masters who had tried so hard to bar
the young feet out of the paths of art.</p>

<p>For a year Madam Urso remained in France studying,
listening to the best music to be heard, mingling
with players of her own artistic stature and, as it were,
renewing her musical youth by drinking deep at the
fountains that flow from one of the great art centres of
the world. Dear, sleepy old Nantes was visited and once
more she played in the same old place where she first
drew her bow in those almost forgotten days of her
childhood. Not a thing had changed. It seemed as if
even the same cats sat on the sunny walls and as if the
same old women filled their water jars at the fountains
and toiled up and down the steep streets. There were
the geraniums in the windows just as she had seen them
in her childhood. Her father&#8217;s organ stood in the
dusty organ loft at the church of the Holy Cross, and
even the same grey cobwebs festooned the arches above
the seat where she used to sit and listen to the music.
All her father&#8217;s old friends came to see her and brought
their grandchildren. The Town Hall would not contain
the hundreds that besieged the doors to see the
Rose of Montholon, the woman who had made their
town famous.</p>

<p>Many places in France were visited, and many concerts
were given in Paris and other cities. It was a
life of success, honors and happiness. More than all,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>it was home. For all that, another home claimed her,
she must return to her adopted home, and in September
1866, Madam Urso returned to this country with
renewed musical strength, increased ability and her
talents brought to even higher culture than ever.</p>

<p>Every life has its dull spots&mdash;its period of uneventful
living. Even public life with its exciting experiences,
perpetual change and scenes, its endless procession
of new faces may in time become monotonous.
The artist life of Camilla Urso has been active and varied
to a remarkable degree, but to repeat the details
of such a succession of concert tours would be simply
wearisome. Events are of small consequence except
as illustrative of character and we must only select
such as serve to show the woman and the artist in
her true character. On returning from Europe Madam
Urso at once resumed her concerts and appeared in
New York and others cities. In January, 1867, she
was engaged to play the <i>Mendelssohn Concerto</i> at one
of the concerts of the Harvard Musical Association in
Boston, and in order to be present in good season for
rehearsal started two days before from New York by
the way of Springfield. On the road she encountered
a severe snow storm and was blockaded thirty-six
hours between Worcester and Boston. Determined
to keep her engagement with the Harvards she pushed
on as long as the train would move. Again and again
they were stopped, in gigantic drifts that came up
to the tops of the cars. The train people resolutely
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>shoveled their way through and pushed on again
The day of the concert came and still they were
twenty miles or more from Boston. The fires gave out
and not a thing could be obtained to eat or drink.
Still she would not give it up. Perhaps the train
would yet reach the city in time for the concert. Finally
the city came in sight. The wind had blown the
the snow away from the track on the marshes behind
the city and the last mile was made in good time and
then the train plunged into another drift just beyond
the junction of the Providence Railroad and where the
Dartmouth street bridge now stands. It only lacked
60 minutes of the concert hour. She would leave the
cars and walk into the city. Perhaps she might be in
time yet. One of the gentlemen of the party took her
violin case and they set out to reach the houses on
Boylston street that were in plain sight not twenty rods
away. It was a desperate undertaking but she resolved
to try it. She must get to the Music Hall if possible.
The snow might be overcome but she had not reckoned
on the temperature, and before she had gone twenty
yards down the track she found her hands were rapidly
freezing and she seemed ready to faint and fall in the
terrible cold. The gentlemen at once took her up and
after a tremendous effort succeeded in carrying her as
far as the signal house. She must get into shelter or perish
almost in our streets. The burly signal man saw
the party and opened the door of his round house and
took them in. Madam Urso&#8217;s hands were stiff and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>bloodless and in their fright her friends thought they
were forever lost. Even Madam Urso&#8217;s strong, brave
spirit was utterly broken down over the appalling disaster.
Of what use was her life if the cunning of her
fingers was to be thus rudely destroyed. It is small
wonder that the disaster almost crushed her and
brought the bitterest tears to her eyes. The grimy
signal man took in the situation at once and resorted
to measures that were at once as effectual as they were
grotesque and amusing. Kneeling down on the floor
and taking off his cap he bid the gentlemen rub her
hands in his tangled and matted hair. It was a most
ludicrous remedy but it worked to a charm. The gentle
heat brought the blood slowly back and after half
an hour&#8217;s rubbing on the man&#8217;s big head she entirely
recovered.</p>

<p>&#8220;Thet&#8217;s the way we always does, mum. Many&#8217;s the
poor brakeman&#8217;s fingers I&#8217;ve saved by rubbin &#8217;em in
some one&#8217;s thick head o&#8217; hair.&#8221;</p>

<p>Whatever the philosophy of this wonderful method
of treatment, Madam Urso can give her testimony to its
perfect success, and within an hour she was so far recovered
that she could laugh as heartily as any over the
adventure. The concert hour had come and gone
while the party were sheltered in the signal house on
the Back Bay and there was no help for it. She had
done her best and even risked her life to fulfill her
engagement. There was nothing more to be done except
to reach the city in safety. The signal man
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>helped the party over the tracks and up the banks
and they set out once more for Boylston Street. After
a severe struggle the party reached the first house but
as the cold was intense they decided to get under shelter
as quickly as possible and at once rang the bell. A
woman put a frightened face out the door and gave one
look at the sorry looking party and slammed the door
in their faces. They at once rang the next bell but
here the people wouldn&#8217;t even open the door though
they slyly peeped out the window at the forlorn looking
party on the steps. Madam Urso&#8217;s hands were
again growing intensely cold in spite of the fur gloves
she had accepted from one of the gentlemen; and his
own hands were bare. They must get in somewhere
or perish in the storm. The next house opened to
them at once, and in spite of their rather battered
looks they were welcomed and offered the best the house
contained. The bath-room, chambers and dining hall
were free to them and it seemed as if the daughters of
the house could not do enough to minister to the wants
of the unhappy party. The discovery of whom they
entertained only added to the warmth of the reception
and finally a sleigh was found and just at night fall
Madam Urso was once more with friends. Singular as
it may seem, she has not found out to this day who so
kindly opened their house to her in her distress. In
the storm and excitement of the occasion the number
of the house was forgotten and there was no name on
the door. The family did not give their name and if
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>it should so happen that they read this, they may know
how pleasantly Madam Urso cherishes the memory of
their kindness.</p>

<p>Carl Rosa who was then in Boston took Madam Urso&#8217;s
place at the Harvard Concert, and on the next
morning Mr. Dwight the Treasurer called and paid her
the usual honorarium, just as if she had been present.
Madam Urso remained in Boston and appeared at the
next concert as she makes it a rule always to fulfill
every engagement to the letter, whatever may be the
expense and inconvenience it may cause her.</p>

<p>Immediately after the little adventure in Boston,
just mentioned, Madam Urso was engaged by Mr.
P. S. Gilmore to travel through the New England
States. This tour was a very successful one and at
its close she spent the Summer quietly at Saratoga
and Long Branch. The season of 1867 and 1868
was an exceedingly busy one and engagements were
made in all parts of the country with uniform success.
In the Spring she found the labor and travel were telling
upon her health, and in June she sailed once more
for Europe where she spent three months in Bologne
and Paris, in retirement. Though not giving concerts
she practiced as steadily and earnestly as her health
would permit. The quiet sea-shore life at Bologne, the
drives on the beach and the charming social life rested
her fully and in September she was once more ready to
resume her profession in this country. To report it all
is quite beyond our limits. Engagements to play
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>crowded upon her from all parts of the country, and
every concert seemed to be more successful than the
last. One given as a complementary testimonial to
Madam Urso by the musicians of Boston, in January
1869, brought out all her friends and packed the Music
Hall with an audience such as it never saw before.
About the same time she was elected an honorary life
member of the Philharmonic Society of Philadelphia.
This Summer, like the last, was passed in Bologne and
Paris and was wholly devoted to study and practice,
with some recreation.</p>

<span class="caption">THE SILVER BRICK.</span></h2>


<p>On the 24th of September (1869) Madam Urso
started from Paris for a new and untried field. Stopping
one week only in New York she pushed on
towards the Pacific and landed in San Francisco on
the 22d of October. Only four weeks from Paris to
San Francisco including six days in New York. This
will illustrate her power of physical endurance, and
the experience that followed this rapid journey will
serve to show her business capacity, her executive talents,
and her indomitable energy. The seven months
passed in California make one of the most remarkable
episodes of her life and it must be examined in some
detail.</p>

<p>The party took rooms at the Occidental Hotel and
the very first evening Madam Urso was honored by a
serenade, though no announcement of her arrival had
been made. Certainly, the musical people of the Pacific
Slope were eager to welcome her. It seemed so,
for on announcing a concert at Platt Hall, there was a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>greater demand for tickets than had ever been known
in that part of the country for any entertainment whatever
its character. Three more concerts were given
with every available seat and standing place occupied,
and then three sacred concerts on successive Sunday
evenings at the California Theatre, were announced.
All of these concerts were of a classical character, the
first of the kind ever given in the State and to bring
them out properly the best talent to be found was engaged,
including the Brignoli Opera Troupe then traveling
in California.</p>

<p>Never in her experience had concert giving been
more successful and profitable than here. It seemed as
if she had captured all their hearts and brought the
golden State to her feet by one wave of her violin bow.
Deeply sensible of the feelings of respect and admiration
entertained for her by the people she resolved in
some way to testify her appreciation and to give material
expression of her thanks. She looked about for
some worthy institution upon which she could bestow
the benefit of a series of concerts, or musical festival.
After some investigation and private correspondence
Madam Urso wrote the following letter that was dated
at the Occidental Hotel, San Francisco, December 1st
1869.</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p><i>To the President and Board of Directors of the
Mercantile Library Association of San Francisco</i>:</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gentlemen</span>: The present embarrassment of your
Society having come to my knowledge, and wishing in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>some suitable manner to show my gratitude to the people
of this city for the kindness and appreciation I
have met with during my visit, I have thought of no
better method to do so than in offering you the benefit
of a grand musical entertainment such as I originally
intended giving here, with the sincere hope that it may
prove a help towards relieving the Mercantile Library
of its present difficulties.</p>

<p>Should my offer be accepted, I will, gentlemen, consecrate
all my time during the two months necessary
for its preparation, to make it a grand success. I am
gentlemen, Yours obediently</p>

<p class="signature">CAMILLA URSO.</p>
</div>

<p>This generous offer was at once accepted and without
delay the officers of the Association, the city government,
and in fact, the whole community united with
her to make the proposed festival one of the great
musical events of the Pacific Slope. Boston had given
its musical festival, why not San Francisco? There, it
had been comparatively easy. Here, it was an undertaking
almost too vast and difficult for comprehension.
There was not a choral society in the State. If there
were a few choirs of male voices they had never sung
together and though there were many individual singers
and performers in different parts of the State they
had never been brought together. A hall must be prepared,
the orchestra drilled, the music for the chorus
selected and printed, and the whole festival lasting
three days be planned, laid out, and carried into effect.</p>

<p>Never before has a single woman been so made a
queen over an army of men, women and children.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>The moment the event was announced the Occidental
Hotel was besieged by editors, musicians, officials, contractors,
carpenters, decorators, chorus masters and a
hundred others who thought they might be of use
in some way. Madam Urso held high state in her
rooms and heard each one in turn, gave him her commands,
and bid him move on to his appointed work.
The Mechanics&#8217; Pavilion, a huge wooden structure
erected for the Mechanics&#8217; Institute Fair in 1868, was
still standing. Orders to take it down had been given,
but at her request they were revoked and a host of carpenters
swarmed into the building and began to remodel
it for the great Festival. Railroads, Hotels, and
Telegraph companies were ready to obey her every wish
in regard to the reception of the great company to be
assembled. The State arsenal opened at her command
and a whole park of artillery was ready to speak at the
wave of her baton. An organ was built to order, and
a drum more portentous than the Gilmore affair was
manufactured. The firemen met to pound the anvils
in the &#8220;anvil chorus&#8221; and Camilla herself drilled them
in the work. And at the head of it all was the one
woman, mistress of the whole kingdom, and with the
resources of a State at command. As if this was not
enough she personally assumed the entire expense and
was responsible for the whole vast sum of thousands
and thousands of dollars that the festival involved.
Had it been a failure the Mercantile Association would
not have lost a dollar. Every bill was in her own
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>name, be it for organ, contractors, printing music books
or agents&#8217; fares by rail or boat.</p>

<p>The event exceeded expectation and was one of the
most marked musical successes ever recorded. On
Washington&#8217;s birth-day, February 22d, 1870, ten thousand
people filled the Mechanics&#8217; Pavilion to listen
to Camilla Urso&#8217;s concert. A chorus of twelve hundred
composed the choir, and an orchestra of two hundred
good musicians furnished the accompaniment for
the choral members.</p>

<p>The programme was popular in its character and
each piece was given with unexpected effect. The
concert was opened at half past two by the performance
of Von Weber&#8217;s Jubilee Overture by the orchestra
under the direction of Mr. Harold, the conductor
of the festival. This was followed by a chorus for men&#8217;s
voices by the united singing societies of the State.
Next the orchestra and military bands gave a selection
of national airs and at the end the chorus and the entire
audience rose and sang &#8220;My country &#8217;tis of Thee.&#8221;
The chorus, organ and orchestra then united to give the
chorus &#8220;Night shades no longer,&#8221; from Moses in Egypt,
which was given in a skillful and effective manner. A
chorus of men&#8217;s voices from &#8220;Eurianthe&#8221; with horn
obligato was next performed and then came the Anvil
Chorus, with chorus, bands, orchestra, organ, battery
and all the bells in the city united for accompaniment.</p>

<p>It was an event in its way and the irrepressible enthusiasm
peculiar to the Californians found vent in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>cheers and the waving of hats, handkerchiefs and whatever
was in hand. Certainly Madam Urso had never
in her whole experience seen such enthusiasm and she
may have well wondered if it was not all some strange,
fantastic dream. The band gave a selection from
&#8220;Tannhauser&#8221; and then the concert closed with the
&#8220;Star Spangled Banner&#8221; given with cannon, big drum,
church bells, organ and great chorus.</p>

<p>The concert on the second day was honored with an
audience of fifteen thousand persons, the largest assembly
that had ever met in California. The programme
began with the overture to &#8220;Ali Baba&#8221; which was followed
by the &#8220;Gloria,&#8221; from Mozart&#8217;s Twelfth Mass.
Then the orchestra gave two movements from the symphony
in C, by Gade. &#8220;Sleepers wake,&#8221; from St. Paul,
and the &#8220;Prayer,&#8221; from &#8220;Moses in Egypt,&#8221; were next
given in such a superior manner by the chorus, that
the last number won an encore.</p>

<p>At this point Madam Urso appeared and met with
a reception that for wild enthusiasm and fervor has
probably never been exceeded by any concert audience.
The very proper coldness and passiveness of
Eastern audiences finds small favor beyond the mountains.
The fifteen thousand people met under that
roof tendered her an ovation the like of which has
probably never been given to any artist in the world.
Respect and love for the woman who had done so much
for them, admiration for her genius, and gratitude for
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>her splendid efforts in behalf of the Mercantile Association
roused the people to a pitch of excitement almost
past belief. For a few moments it seemed as if they
would never cease cheering, nor stop piling the mountains
of flowers at her feet.</p>

<p>Then she took her violin and played for them, giving
the Beethoven Concerto. The building was too vast
for all to hear her instrument but they listened in
eager silence and at the close there was another tempest
of applause and showers of flowers till the stage
about her was literally &#8220;knee deep in fragrance.&#8221; She
was twice called out after the performance, but the excitement
and fatigue were too much for her and
she declined to play again.</p>

<p>The chorus&mdash;&#8220;The Heavens are Telling,&#8221; the overture
to &#8220;Der Freyschutz,&#8221; the Anvil Chorus, and the
&#8220;Hallelujah&#8221; chorus, from the Messiah concluded the
entertainment and the vast audience quietly dispersed.</p>

<p>The third day of the Festival was perhaps the most
remarkable of all. The chorus on this day consisted
of two thousand public school children, under the
musical direction of Mr. Elliot, of San Francisco. The
programme consisted of orchestral selections and choruses
from the song books used in the public schools,
sung by the children. The Hall was packed to its utmost
limits and the concert was a perfect success, both
in the high character of the music given, and the excellent
manner with which it was rendered. We have
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>Madam Urso&#8217;s testimony that the singing of the children
was fully equal to the singing heard in the schools
of Boston and other Eastern cities. Madam Urso
played a selection of popular airs, including &#8220;Home,
Sweet Home,&#8221; and the national melodies, to the great
delight of the young chorus, and the immense audience
assembled to hear them. This children&#8217;s concert
was very successful and to gratify the great number
of people who wished to attend it was repeated on
the following Saturday.</p>

<p>On Thursday evening the seats were removed from
the Pavilion and a grand ball was given in compliment
to Madam Urso. The next day, Friday, the chorus
and the orchestra volunteered and gave her a benefit
concert. Like the other concerts of the Festival it was
a great success, and gave fifteen thousand people an
opportunity to listen to her playing, and to testify to
their admiration of her work in their behalf. With
the children&#8217;s concert on Saturday afternoon the Festival
week was brought to a successful close. There
was not an accident to mar the pleasure of the occasion
and the cause of music in California received an impulse
that may be felt to this day. The Mercantile
Library received a gift of $27,000 as the result after
every bill had been paid and everything promptly and
thoroughly cleared up.</p>

<p>In looking at this singular episode in the life of
Madam Urso we hardly know which to admire the
most, the business skill and energy that carried it
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>through to a financial success, the womanly qualities
that could win and hold the willing services of so many
people in every walk of life or the artistic culture and
insight that arranged the programme so as to at once
please and instruct. The concerts were not too classical
to drive the people away nor were they wholly popular.
In all Madam Urso&#8217;s art life it has always been
her aim to lift up and instruct her hearers. First allure
the people with simple music that they can understand
and then give them something from the masters, something
a little above their comprehension; a taste of
classical music. They would receive a little of the
pure and true art and in time they would learn to ask
for nothing else. If she gave them nothing but high
art they would be repelled and would not listen to any
art at all. The concerts in California and those of the
festival were arranged on this plan, and she remained
on the Pacific coast long enough to see the wisdom of
her method and to find that the people came to hear her
gladly when she preached the gospel of true and high
art. She has ever pursued this high aim and has lived
to see a remarkable change come over the American
people in their love of music. Of this more farther on.</p>

<p>Soon after the festival Madam Urso made an extensive
concert tour through the interior towns of California
and everywhere met with a most flattering reception.
The musical societies that had sprung into existence at
her command to assist in the festival turned out to welcome
her in every town, the general interest in music
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>that the event had awakened throughout the State
seemed to have spread to most remote and out of the
way corners among the mountains, and every town
seemed to try to out-do the rest in showing her attention
and in crowding her concerts. At Virginia City
the choral Society gave her a reception and elected her
an honorary member of their association. Each member
was expected to wear a badge of a miniature silver
brick. They presented her with a real silver brick,
(life size) and as it was too heavy to wear or even lift
from the floor, they presented two bricks of smaller
size, in the shape of ear rings. Certainly it was a most
extraordinary present, in admirable keeping with the
place and the people.</p>

<p>After visiting all the principal places of interest
among the mountains and having a most delightful and
interesting journey, Madam Urso returned to San
Francisco in May. Here she gave a few concerts and
on the 16th of the month started once more for Paris
and taking with her, the famous silver brick, a most
beautiful diamond pendant, and gold chain, a gift from
San Francisco friends, the respect and good wishes of
thousands of people whom she had charmed with her
music and her warm heart, and $22,000 in gold as the
net result of her visit.</p>

<p>On the 18th of the following month she was once
more in the quiet of her own home in Paris.</p>

<p>It is not a matter of surprise to find that after
Madam Urso&#8217;s seven months&#8217; experience in California
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>there came a severe physical reaction. The labor and
anxiety of the trip were tremendous, and even her
iron constitution gave way, and she broke down utterly
the moment the excitement of her journey to
Paris was over. For three months she was confined to
her room with brain fever, and only left it when she
was driven out of the city by the events of the Franco-Prussian
war. She was hastily removed from her
house on a stretcher, on the 15th of September, and
took one of the last trains that left the city before the
siege, and was carried on her bed to Boulogne. The
change was a fortunate one; the sea air brought a favorable
change in her illness, and her health was restored.
In October she was sufficiently recovered to
bear the journey to England, and she took up her residence
in London.</p>

<p>The winter of 1870 and &#8217;71 was passed in private
life, but not by any means in idleness. It seemed as if
she had now won a position in which she could command
her time for study and practice. This great
artist, who had commanded the plaudits of two continents,
quietly gave herself up to renewed study, to
more faithful practice, and to still greater efforts towards
perfection in her art. In London she could
hear the greatest players in the world. The finest
and most scholarly programmes were to be heard every
week. She had nothing to do but to hear the best
music, study the styles of the masters, catch the
splendid inspiration of their works, and to transfer to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>her own heart and hand whatever of the great and
fine in music they had to offer to her. It was a winter
of hard work upon her violin, and a season of peace
and rest from the dreadful wear and tear of public
artist life, and its fruits may to-day be seen in the eminence
she has attained in the very highest walks of
violin music. The classical concerts that she gave in
Boston three years later testify to the conscientious
labor that was bestowed upon her instrument during
this quiet winter in London.</p>

<p>Here do we see the true artist-soul. We here catch
the earnest meaning of Camilla Urso&#8217;s life&mdash;the intense
love of music, the devotion to its highest aims, the
eagerness to work, to study and to learn all that is best
and true. Genius, indeed, shines in her music, but
without these years of honest work the genius would
only be a delusion and a mockery. With work it
becomes almost divine.</p>

<p>In June of 1871, Madam Urso returned to Paris and
spent the summer there in comparative retirement.
She gave no public performances, but held musical
receptions at her own house once a week, that were
attended by all the most noted artists who lived in
Paris or visited the city during that summer.</p>

<p>In the early winter, in reply to a summons from
London, Madam Urso appeared at the Memorial Concert
to Mendelssohn, and played his great concerto at
the Crystal Palace, Sydenham. This was her first
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>appearance in England, and, as we can well understand,
it immediately placed her in a foremost position
among the artists of that country. After giving a few
concerts in Paris, she again took up her artist life, and
appeared at the St. James&#8217; Hall in February, 1872.</p>

<p>These two concerts in London and Sydenham at
once opened wide the door to a new field in which her
talents found general recognition and constant employment.
If the California experience seemed like some
Eastern dream, this season in London was like stepping
back into the last century, when princes and dukes
gave banquets to musicians and entertained minstrels
with royal liberality. Invitations to play before both
the Old and New Philharmonic Societies, and at many
other notable musical gatherings came to her faster
than she could accept them. She played for the Royal
Society of Musicians, the Duke of Edinburgh presiding
on the occasion, and she was also asked by the Duke
of Edinburgh to play at Montague House at a reception
given in his honor by the Duchess of Buccleuch.
Other persons of distinction in London invited her,
and everywhere she charmed them all by the grace
and beautiful finish of her playing, and by her unaffected
and simple manners. Invitations to play at
private houses came so fast that a carriage was kept in
waiting to take her from house to house, that she might
appear and play at several different places the same
night.</p>

<p>To republican readers, this appearing at private
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>houses for pay may seem peculiar and perhaps beneath
the dignity of the true artist. It is the custom of the
country. Persons of wealth wishing to entertain their
friends give a musical evening, at which a programme
of choice music is given by artists hired for the occasion.
Usually each performer gives one piece and then
retires. He is not expected to appear till just before
his turn comes, and then he briefly presents his respects
to the lady of the house, plays his little piece and
gathers his wedding garments about him and flies away
in a Hansom cab to the next house, where he does it
all over again. Then he rattles through the deserted
streets at break-neck speed to be on time at another
palatial mansion, where his piece appears near the end
of the programme. The audiences hardly have time
to learn who is playing or singing before the bird has
flown and a new one, just out of his carriage, is ready
to sing and fly again. The very much dressed audience
comes and goes at each place, and the music is often
drowned in the clatter of half empty wine-glasses and
the rattle of more empty heads. It is very grand, exceedingly
tiresome, and wonderfully profitable. A
player or singer of first-class reputation who is willing
to follow up a London season in this style, can win more
money than by a year of concert giving. Each house
pays for its one piece of music, and as many as five
houses can be visited in one evening.</p>

<p>It is a rather startling method of procedure, but it
is the custom of the country. Madam Urso could not
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>decline to do as all the other musicians did, however
much she might stand on the simple dignity of her
American name. She everywhere called herself an
American, and, as it always happens, won the more
respect and admiration for her independence. It is
always an advantage to be known as an American in
Europe, and Madam Urso is only too glad and proud
to acknowledge all that she owes to the country of her
adoption.</p>

<p>The English press could here be largely quoted, to
give some idea of the high position Madam Urso won
in the musical world at that great art centre. It is
needless to give it, as it is well known that her American
reputation, great as it is, is not equal to that in
England. The English are even more willing to give
Camilla Urso her honors due than are we, and having
said this we have said enough.</p>

<p>In July, 1872, Madam Urso returned to Boulogne,
and after a short rest returned to New York, early
in September. A concert tour through the Canadas
was at once taken, and after a brief and most successful
trip, she returned to New York. She afterwards
made a journey to New Orleans, where she assisted at
the opening of the new Exposition Hall. Unfortunately,
Camilla Urso was here taken sick with the
chills and fever, and was obliged to come North at
once. She came to Boston, but lost much valuable
time, both from concerts and practice, by a long illness
at the St. James Hotel.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>We now come, as it were, in sight of the present
time. The year 1873, though it was a disastrous one
to art interests generally, by reason of the panic, was
one of uninterrupted success for Madam Urso. She
took a brief rest during the summer near New York,
but during the remainder of the time gave an uninterrupted
succession of concerts in all the Northern States,
so that it seems as if the sound of her violin still rang
in our ears.</p>

<span class="caption">THE GOSPEL OF WORK.</span></h2>


<p>It is now in order to review briefly the events of this
remarkable art life, and to see what lessons it may
teach to the musician, the student, and the art lover.
Whether we look at the child, gazing in large-eyed
wonder at the festival in the Church of the Holy Cross,
the patient girl, trudging day by day through the quiet
streets of Nantes to take her lessons, the pale student
in the conservatory, the sober-faced maiden who so won
all our hearts so long ago in Boston, the brilliant young
woman who flashed out so suddenly into the highest
walks of art, the great artist born of a wonder child,
or the simple American woman, Camilla Urso, in whatever
station we view her, we see the dignity and reward
of honest work. Everywhere we see the same passionate
love of music, the same eagerness to study, to learn
the all there is of it, and to play with ever increasing
skill. Genius is the great gift that has been bestowed
upon her. She did not hide it in a napkin,
but with heart and soul she did her best to make it a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>good and acceptable gift to art and humanity. Whether
giving concerts among our prairie cities, resting by the
sea-shore at Boulogne, traveling among the mountains
of California, studying the great masters of the violin
in London or Paris, or among friends in Boston, she is
always practicing upon her beloved instrument. It is
never out of her hands a day, unless ill or fatigued by
traveling. Each month she means shall show some
improvement, and from year to year she has gone on
till the present standard of excellence has been reached.
To what perfection her skill has been carried, we
shall leave others to say at the end of this book.</p>

<p>The musician, in looking back over this life of an
artist, naturally asks what changes she may have seen
in the art life of the world during the dozen years or
more she has been before the American public. We
purposely select the American public, because it is of
the most interest to us, and because the art life of
Europe is somewhat different from ours, and less liable
to changes. Madam Urso&#8217;s own views upon the subject
are instructive and encouraging, and we present them
in very nearly her own words. Taken as a whole, the
people of this country are somewhat crude and uneducated
in their ideas of music. They certainly love
music; they like music even better than the Europeans,
but they do not exactly know what they want. If,
when an orchestra or an artist is visiting a Western
town, you ask a man if he is going to the concert, he
will often say, &#8220;No, I have seen him once.&#8221; Hearing the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>music given by a splendid orchestra does not seem to be
thought of any consequence. Having &#8220;seen&#8221; the orchestra,
there is no further interest in it. On the other
hand, with all their want of education, the people of this
country learn about music faster than any people she
ever saw. They are greatly interested in music, are willing
to admit their ignorance concerning it, are exceedingly
eager to learn and anxious that their children
should, at least, study the rudiments, that they
may enjoy and understand it. They are ready and
able to pay more for music than any nation in Europe.
If they think they are really to hear something that
pleases them, they will pack the hall whatever the
price. The music that pleases them is not always the
best, for the simple reason they do not know what is
best. As fast as they learn better, they drop whatever
is before them and at once take up something else.
The sudden disappearance of negro minstrel music is
an evidence of this. The people outgrew it, and it
passed away, as it were, in a night.</p>

<p>In instrumental music there has been a steady advance
from the merely showy and technical to the
purely classical. Ten years since they would crowd
the hall to hear the &#8220;Carnival.&#8221; Had Madam Urso
presented the Beethoven Spohr, or the Mendelssohn
Concertos, the people would not have listened in patience
through a single performance. If they heard it
at all, it would be under a sort of silent protest, and the
next time the piece was offered there would be nobody
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>there. These remarks apply to the country generally.
In some of the older cities classical music of a high
order would have found a certain proportion of listeners.
From year to year, all this has changed. By
introducing into the lightest and most popular programmes
some short selection from the great masters of
violin music, Madam Urso has gradually taught her
audiences what they should admire, and, by persistent
and gentle urging, she has led them to a knowledge
of the best and highest in art. In this Madam Urso is
not alone. All true artists do thus teach the people
and try to lift them up to something higher and purer.
It is this that makes the divine in music. Happily, our
people are willing enough to be taught. The general
education, and our freedom from precedents enables all
art to grow faster here than anywhere else. We are
still, as a people, crude and musically ignorant, but we
are fast learning. The changes in the character of
concert music may be seen almost from year to year;
the standard continually advances and, certainly, there
is everything to encourage and satisfy the most ardent
lover of music in the country. While we have such
artists as Madam Urso among us we have much to be
thankful for, and may press on till we reach the high
standard of excellence she ever keeps before herself.</p>

<p>We may here offer a short sketch of Madam Urso&#8217;s
personal appearance and manners, when free from the
restraint of public life. The ideas generally held concerning
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>her &#8220;personally&#8221; are somewhat incorrect, as
the following will show:</p>

<p class="tb">*<span class="spaced">*</span><span class="spaced">*</span><span class="spaced">*</span><span class="spaced">*</span><span class="spaced">*</span></p>

<p>It was a cloudy, winter&#8217;s afternoon, and the place
seemed dull and gloomy. The Boston Music Hall is,
at best, bare and vast, and by daylight is particularly
unattractive. The great organ pipes appear cold and
lustreless, and the light tints on the walls are not very
comforting. The orchestra of the Harvard Musical
Association were upon the stage, under the leadership
of Carl Zerrahn, and a few privileged subscribers,
numbering a hundred or two, were gathered together
at one side, as if to keep each other in countenance.
Over such a wide floor it takes a thousand or more to
make a comfortable and social company.</p>

<p>The orchestra were at work upon the 6th Symphony
of Beethoven, placidly overcoming its difficulties, stopping
now and then to polish up some delicate point,
and taking things in an easy and rather indifferent
manner. In the midst of it entered at the side door a
young woman in fur cape, skull cap of the jauntiest
pattern, and some plain dark dress. The hackman
came behind, bearing the great brown leather violin
case. With a serene and placid manner she mounted
the stage, and bidding the man place the violin case
on the steps before the organ, she quietly took off her
outer garments and sat down on the steps. A friendly
nod and a smile to Zerrahn and then a cordial hand
shake to the librarian of the Society. She had brought
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>the orchestral parts of the concerto she was to play,
and began to talk in an animated manner about their
use. The audience had no longer any ears for the
symphony, and though it went steadily on, they were
all eyes to see and admire their favorite thus &#8220;at home&#8221;
among them.</p>

<p>Having arranged everything to her satisfaction, she
came down into the house and was quickly surrounded
by a group of artists and others. For all she had
a hearty hand shake, a smile, and words of genial and
animated welcome. No pretty miss in the company
more admired, no merry talker more sought for than
this unaffected, simple-minded woman. Beating time
on the back of the seat with one finger, nodding to acquaintances,
speaking to all in turn, now in French,
and now in the best of English, she sat the most observed
and admired of all the goodly company, and
the most serene and happy.</p>

<p>Presently the symphony rehearsal came to an end,
and, without the slightest hint of affectation, she rose
from her seat, smiled her adieus, and went to the stage.
Selecting a violin from its blue satin wrappings, she
threw a white silk handkerchief over her left shoulder,
tuned her violin, and took her place at the front of the
stage in the centre of the orchestra. Tall Carl Zerrahn
on his stand seems particularly giantesque beside such
a little lady, and he pushed the platform on one side
and stood upon the stage, to be nearer to her. She
gave nods of recognition to members of the orchestra,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>shook hands with Zerrahn, smiled and talked merrily
with the leading violin, and then explained something
concerning the music to Zerrahn. With her bow she
gave the time, and the opening prelude began. She
adjusted her handkerchief to her shoulder, and with a
light touch played snatches of the orchestral part, as if
to give a hint as to its proper rendering. Now comes
the solo. The accompaniment is hushed, that not a
note of the golden Mozartian melody be lost. Of her
performance we will not here speak in detail, as it is
described a page or two further on. Our present concern
is with Madam Urso as a woman at home in her
art, and among friends. Suddenly, in the midst of a
brilliant passage, she stops, and lifting one finger she
says, so that all can hear: &#8220;F natural.&#8221; The first
violins are caught napping, and without a book, and
while playing her own part, she detects and corrects a
mistake of a semitone in the accompaniment. There
is no self-assertion or parade, but only an arch smile
and a merry shake of the head, as if it was a good joke
to catch them thus. A hearty laugh from orchestra
and audience, and then the work is resumed. As the
piece returns, she nods and smiles her approval, and
the music goes on again. At the end of the movement
comes a long <i>cadenza</i> of great difficulty. She treats
it in that masterly and effective manner that seems so
natural to her. Then follows a liberal round of applause
from orchestra and spectators. Next comes the
<i>andante</i> movement, the most beautiful of the three.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>During the brief interval between the two she talks
merrily with one and another, and when she is ready
gives the time to the conductor. Zerrahn wields the
<i>baton</i>, but Madam Urso is the real director. Her spirit
guides the music and inspires the orchestra with unusual
animation. The rather listless manner in the
symphony is exchanged for painstaking care and attention.
Camilla&#8217;s earnestness and life seems to inspire
them to greater effort, and their playing gains in vigor
and precision. &#8220;Not too much fire, gentlemen.&#8221; This
is the slow movement, and she gently represses their
enthusiasm. The feather like touch, the airy delicacy
of her own playing, spurs them on to unwonted care
and restraint. At the end comes another long <i>cadenza</i>,
that for soft, whispering tones, sweetness, grace, and
vanishing lightness, is almost unequaled. Her face
becomes serious. Her eyes have a far away expression,
dreamy and tender, that soon affects the music. The
magic violin sighs and breathes in melting tenderness.
The melody floats upward, melting and fading away,
exhaled into palpable silence. Not quite, for just as it
seems ready to languish into nothing, a soft, sweet
chord from the band completes the cadence and brings
it to a natural end.</p>

<p>Shouts of &#8220;bravo&#8221; and loud applause greet this
splendid effort, and she nods and smiles with a pleased
and natural expression. Still, she is not satisfied. The
band are not sufficiently delicate and light in the treatment
of the last chord or two, and she bids them try it
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>again. Three times they go over it, before her exacting
and lofty standard of perfection is reached.</p>

<p>Then comes the last movement. Vivacious, animated,
and merry, it seems to suit her happy hearted
nature, and she fairly revels in its brilliant melodies.
Difficulties vanish like mist before the sun. It becomes
a delight to dash through the sparkling passages.
Clear, clean cut, vivid and sharp, like cut glass, the
music stands out in bold characters. Not a note slighted
or blurred. No obscurity or doubt about the most intricate
passage. Curious little effects of <i>staccato</i> mingled
with the most linked together <i>legato</i>. Bold flashes
through chain lightning scales. Chords pouring forth
in torrents, and then airy scraps of melody, as if the
theme had broken up into shining bits, glistening drops,
and sparkles of song.</p>

<p>An artist soul blooms before us. Her face is rapt,
and almost severe. In a moment it is over, and her
features break into a pleasant, natural smile. Amid
the applause she returns to the floor and mingles with
the people. No affectation, no looking for praise;
nothing but sweetness and friendliness. No common-place
woman, with brush or needle in hand, could be
more simple and winsome, no genius could be more
self-forgetting.</p>

<p>We may now properly close the chapter, and bring
this story of an artist life up to the present time by a
brief sketch of a series of classical concerts given by
Madam Urso in the Spring of 1874, in Boston. They
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>were remarkable concerts; both in the character of
the music given, and in the crowded and appreciative
audiences that attended them. As an expression of
Madam Urso&#8217;s present ability as an artist, we offer the
opinion of the <i>Boston Daily Advertiser</i>, our best local
critical paper, and, for the present, bring this story to
its logical end. May it be many years before it becomes
necessary to add anything more to it, except to
record her continued success as an artist, and happiness
as a good and true woman.</p>

<p>The <i>Advertiser&#8217;s</i> criticism upon the first concert of
the series we present in full for the reason that it expresses
the critic&#8217;s opinion of Madam Urso&#8217;s general
character as a musical <i>artiste</i>, directress, and manager,
as well as of her rank and position as a violinist:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>&#8220;The Horticultural Hall was entirely filled last
evening, and Madam Camilla Urso was welcomed back
to Boston with an enthusiasm evidently as unaffected
as it was hearty. The programme of the concert was
singularly choice, but it was noticeable especially for
the contrast which it presented to the bills of most of
our <i>virtuosi</i>: in three of its numbers only did Madam
Urso take part, and those three were a trio for violin,
piano, and violoncello, a sonata for violin and piano,
and a string quartette. Disappointment at not hearing
the principal musician in a solo performance may have
marred the pleasure of some of the audience; and at
the other concerts of the series it is very likely that
some provision may be made for the gratification of
this natural desire. But the entire arrangement of last
night seemed to us significant&mdash;delightfully significant
of that noble, generous, self-forgetting spirit which has
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>always distinguished this remarkable performer, and
which is not the least of her titles to the grand name
of <i>artiste</i>. Here seems to be as little as possible of vain
show of self; nothing at all of that jealous littleness
which tolerates no companions either as composers or
interpreters; the <i>maximum</i> of appreciation and reverence
for the great authors, and of devotion to the best
and worthiest in music. In the concert of last evening
Madam Urso carried the higher principle so far that,
as has been said, her own name appeared alone neither
as author nor performer.</p>

<p>The three chief numbers of this fine programme
were a trio in C-minor, op. 102, by Raff; a sonata in
F-major, No. 9, by Mozart; and Schubert&#8217;s posthumous
quartette in D-minor. The Raff trio was new to Boston.
It is a long and elaborate work, the absolute
merit of which is not to be pronounced upon after a
single hearing. That it is startlingly brilliant and
striking in at least two of its numbers is plain at once,
however; and there can be no denying or doubting its
great vigor and originality. The <i>scherzo</i> has remarkable
ingenuity in its harmonic forms and instrumental combinations;
and the <i>andante</i>, amazing in its melodic
variety and richness, and reflecting, apparently, many
moods of the composer&#8217;s mind, yet produces a unity of
impression which proves the presence of a strong and
self-poised genius. The Mozart sonata for violin and
piano is exceedingly interesting in all its three movements,
light and airy in its general character,&mdash;except
in the <i>andante</i>, which is touched with pensiveness,&mdash;and
not striking very far down in its suggestions, but
full of fresh beauty and consummate in its symmetrical
grace. In the happiest contrast with the sonata was
the wonderful D-minor quartette of Schubert. No
better illustration of the marked divergence between
the modes of expression natural to two master composers
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>could have been chosen than these. The invariable
law of Mozart&#8217;s genius&mdash;in spite of, or perhaps, in aid
of its broad inclusiveness&mdash;is condensation or conciseness;
of Schubert&#8217;s, it is expansion and diffusiveness.
But where the genius is so vital and inspiring as that
which shines in every line of the D-minor quartette,
the amplitude never degenerates into tediousness. There
may be profusion in the host&#8217;s providing, but no surfeit
in the guest&#8217;s appetite.</p>

<p>In considering the quality of the performance one is
tempted at first to the natural remark that Madam
Urso&#8217;s power cannot be so plainly shown in concerted
as in solo music. But in the very utterance, we find
ourselves hesitating and more than doubtful. For
purely mechanical effects and for all the immense
variety of mere instrumental and personal display the
solo, of course, offers unequaled opportunities. But,
after all, of how little real value and beauty are these
pyrotechnics of the profession; how shallow is the stream
of emotion which flows from them, and how barren, dry
and brief is the pleasure which accompanies their recollection!
If proofs were sought that Madam Camilla
Urso retained her skill in all its amazing perfection and
her genius in all its vitality and inspiration, they were
abundant indeed at the concert of last evening. There
was the same grand steadiness and strength; the same
absolute faultlessness in purity of tone; the same fine
discrimination and delicacy; the same minute clearness
and cleanness, so that in the most rapid and difficult
delivery nothing was slurred or confused; the same docile
yielding to the spirit of the composer and to the
demands of her fellow-musicians. And more than this,
there was ample room for the exhibition of the expressive
and sympathetic power, which was always the first
title of Madam Urso&mdash;as of every great violinist&mdash;to
the highest rank in her art. Her violin in these fine
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>concerted pieces spoke with the same &#8220;golden mouth&#8221;
as of old, commanding, inspiring, defying and pleading
by turns. And in such music as that of the well-nigh
incomparable &#8220;<i>Tema con variazioni</i>&#8221; of the Schubert
quartette, the highest eloquence of the king of instruments
is not only permitted but demanded.&#8221;</p></div>

<p>Another view of the professional and technical skill
of Madam Urso is given by the critic of the <i>Advertiser</i>
in the following words:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>&#8220;We have said that Madam Urso&#8217;s place as a violinist
is in the first rank; it is hardly necessary to add,
that among performers of her own sex she is unquestionably
the very first in the world. It is, indeed, only
within a comparatively few years that the claims of
women to superiority as violinists have been treated
with anything better than sneers. And the supercilious
and intolerant spirit which dictated such treatment
had at least a much solider foundation than the narrow
conservatism which refused to admit women into the
lists with poets, novelists, sculptors, and painters: for
power and force are the primal conditions of the
highest success as a performer upon the violin, and
most women would undoubtedly be weak players as
compared with most men. But the genius of art&mdash;who,
after all, is one and the same, whatever form the
art may take&mdash;is no respecter of persons; nay, more,
he demands for his high tasks those of every clime and
rank, and of both sexes. And from each and every
one he asks a peculiar service which no other could
exactly render. And thus he has assigned to Madam
Urso her own functions as an <i>artiste</i>. There is no denying
the remarkable power and breadth of her style,
which is far in advance of that exhibited by the majority
of the best male performers;&mdash;her touch is at once as
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>firm as steel and as soft as velvet; her mere manual
dexterity is extraordinary; and her intonations are as
faultless as the steadiest of hands and the correctest of
ears can make them,&mdash;witness, especially, her recent
wonderful playing of <i>cadenzas</i> at a Harvard Symphony
Concert. In all of this Madam Urso may be said to be
a man, or the equal and compeer of man. But in the
great expressive power to which we have often referred
as her chief title to the highest place, the soul of the
true and earnest woman finds its own exclusive utterance;
and we get a something of tenderness, of
sweetness, and of subtlety which is pre-eminently feminine.
The world could not afford to lose this, though
great performers were twenty times more numerous
than they are. The age which has produced a Dickens
and a &#8220;George Eliot,&#8221; a Holman Hunt and a Rosa
Bonheur, a Story and a Harriet Hosmer, must needs
have added to the scroll upon which the titles of
Joachim, of Vieuxtemps, and of Ole Bull are inscribed,
the name of</p>

<p class="ending">CAMILLA URSO.&#8221;</p>
